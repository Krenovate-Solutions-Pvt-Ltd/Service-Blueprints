Accurate data collection is essential to maintaining the integrity of research, making informed business decisions and ensuring quality assurance. 

##  **Benefits of Data Collection**

When conducting research, collecting original data has significant advantages:

-   You can control and standardize the process for high reliability and validity (e.g. choosing appropriate measurements and sampling methods)
-  It helps in understanding what is currently trending in your area, what people are more curious about, which keyword will work best at that particular time.

##  **Sources of Data Collection**

There are multiple sources of data collection. For eg: surveys, questionnaries, interviews and many more. Nowadays, digital tools help in gathering relevant data and information in a more detailed manner. Below, we will discuss a few commonly used sources:

### **Google Analytics**

Google Analytics is a free web analytics service/tool offered by Google that tracks/monitor and analyse/reports website traffic. It is the most widely used web analytics service on the web.

**Google Analytics is used to :**

-   Track website activity based on some parameters of individuals using the site , along with the information on the source of the traffic.
-   It shows high level, dashboard type data for the casual user.
-   E-commerce tracking can track sales activity and performance.

**Who can view analytics of a Website?**

Access to the analytics being collected for any particular website is limited to those who have login access to the Google Analytics account.

Once, the access is available, the relevant data can be downloaded in form of Excel sheets.

**What Data does Google Analytics collect?**

At its most basic, Google Analytics can collect a lot of data about how people use a website. For eg:

-   Time of visit, pages visited, time spent on each of the webpage.
-   Referring site details (such as a URL through which the user reaches the website)
-   Type of browser
-   Network location and IP Address

With some custom implementation, additional data can be collected which might include:

-   Document downloads
-   clicks on links leading to external websites
-   errors when users fill out forms
-   clicks on videos
-   scroll depth
-   interactions with site specific widgets.

With Google's latest version of Google Analytics, even more data which is not limited to websites, can be tracked:

-   app activity
-   telephone conversations
-   Point of sale transactions
-   RFID or NFC sensor activity

**How does Google Analytics work?**

1.  Google Analytics works via a “page tag”. The page tag is called the “Google Analytics Tracking Code”, and it is a snippet of JavaScript code.
2.  This code is added to every page of the website to be tracked. 
3.  When someone visits the website, the tracking code runs in the visitor’s browser, collects visitor data, and sends it to a Google data collection server.
4.  The usage data is then stored in Google's data collection server.

**How to start tracking users on a website?**

Google Analytics is free to use. All you need are:

-   a Google account
-   a website to track (and the ability to add the Javascript snippet to that website)

### **Secondary Research Methods**

Secondary research is a research method that involves using already existing data. Existing data is summarized and collated to increase the overall effectiveness of research.

Secondary research is much more cost-effective than primary research, as it makes use of already existing data, unlike primary research where data is collected first hand by organizations or businesses or they can employ a third party to collect data on their behalf.

There are many popularly used secondary research methods. In this section, we will discuss some of the methods/ tools available on the internet.
