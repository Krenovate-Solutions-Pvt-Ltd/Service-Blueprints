# **Introduction**

## **What is a Content map?**

- A content map is a plan to deliver the right content, to the right people, at the right time. Building content maps is the first step towards making a good website. 

- It acts as a blueprint of your website. It allows you and your team to be organized and visualize what the site will become.

- It is a valuable tool when you are working with a web design company to produce your website.

Creating a content map helps you understand:

-   **_Where_** in the purchase funnel your content engages customers
-   **_How_** your content helps customers get what they need at each stage
-   **_How_** you can guide customers through the customer journey more effectively

## **What is Content Mapping?**

- Content mapping is a visual technique that will help you organize and understand the content of a website.

- Content Mapping focuses on how each piece of the content strategically relates to and supports the customer/client journey.

- It helps us to relate and connect to each of the phases/steps in a customer journey and helps us to deliver better and meet the needs of our target audience.

- Content mapping takes into account the characteristics of the person who will be consuming the content and their lifecycle stage.


## **Three Pillars of Content Mapping**

To create an effective website you need to keep in mind these three pillars of content mapping which are as follows:

### **Right Content**

This means creating valuable content for the users/customers/clients visiting your website. For example if you have build a website for fashion and clothing you have to put the content for the same and not for health and fitness because if users are visiting a website for fashion and clothing they should be shown content relevant  to fashion and clothing and not health and fitness.That will make more sense to them.

### **Right People**

People who visit your website will be generally from differet age groups, interests and needs. By 'right people' it means if you have build a website for women clothing and showing content for men fashion trends and sales on men wear it will not generate good sales for women clothing as your content is not specific for the people you have defined.

### **Right Time**

By right time we do not mean that your website should have different content on different dates and time. By this we meant that a user/client goes through different stages before coming to a decision. For example Mr. A has to buy a shirt and he is gathering the information for the same from different websites. So he is in the process of getting details but he visits a website whhich is showing him there is a 30% discount for the same. At that particular 'gathering the information' stage he is getting the irrelevant content which he may require later. So it becomes very important for organisations to create the content based on the lifecycle stage of the person visiting the website.

## **Benefits of Content Mapping**

Content mapping has various benefits as discussed below:

-   It helps you understand your customer **needs, goals and questions.**

-   It gives you an **overview of all the content** you have which helps you avoid creating redundant content and hihglights opportunities to reuse or repurpose existing content. 

-   It helps you get the most out of your content : Content mapping makes sure that every piece of content is created with a **purpose** and is fully **optimized to serve that purpose.**

-   **It helps with technology decisions** : By having a good vision as to the direction and potential requirements of the site’s content, we can make wise decisions at the start about the technologies we’ll use, and make sure that the content management system we choose will meet the needs of our content.

-   By being able to visualize your content, content mapping helps quickly **spot gaps and opportunities.**

## **Building a Content Map**

In order to get started with content mapping, here are some things that need to be followed: 

1.  [Data Collection](Data-Collection.md): This involves content research about market size, competitior, users, trends etc.
2.  [User Personas](Building-User-Personas.md) : These are great for understanding the target audience, style trends, user desires etc.
3.  [User Lifecycle](Building-User-Lifecycle.md) : This is the who, what, why, when and how.

##  **Conclusion**

In the end, Content mapping makes your site about your customer, not about your company. Once that happens, your customers will start trusting your company because you make it about them - their needs and their questions; you understand and solve their problems. In return, they will give you their support, trust, and their business.
