# **Content Mapping**

## **What is a Content map?**

- A content map is a plan to deliver the right content, to the right people, at the right time. Building content maps is the first step towards making a good website. 

- It acts as a blueprint of your website. It allows you and your team to be organized and visualize what the site will become.

- It is a valuable tool when you are working with a web design company to produce your website.

## **What is Content Mapping?**

- Content Mapping focuses on how each piece of the content is strategically related to and supports the customer/client journey.

- It helps us to relate and connect to each of the phases/steps in a customer journey and helps us to deliver better and meet the needs of our target audience.

- Content mapping takes into account the characteristics of the person who will be consuming the content and their lifecycle stage.

### **Three Pillars**

To create an effective website you need to keep in mind these three pillars of content mapping which are as follows:

#### **Right Content**

This means creating valuable content for the users/customers/clients visiting your website. For example if you have build a website for fashion and clothing you have to put the content for the same and not for health and fitness because if users are visiting a website for fashion and clothing they should be shown content relevant  to fashion and clothing and not health and fitness.That will make more sense to them.

#### **Right People**

People who visit your website will be generally from differet age groups, interests and needs. By 'right people' it means if you have build a website for women clothing and showing content for men fashion trends and sales on men wear it will not generate good sales for women clothing as your content is not specific for the people you have defined.

#### **Right Time**

By right time we do not mean that your website should have different content on different dates and time. By this we meant that a user/client goes through different stages before coming to a decision. For example Mr. A has to buy a shirt and he is gathering the information for the same from different websites. So he is in the process of getting details but he visits a website whhich is showing him there is a 30% discount for the same. At that particular 'gathering the information' stage he is getting the irrelevant content which he may require later. So it becomes very important for organisations to create the content based on the lifecycle stage of the person visiting the website.

## **Benefits of  Content Mapping**

- It helps you understand your customer and lays out their   journey. 

- It gives you an overview of all the content you have and identify the holes in your content strategy. 

- It helps you get the most out of your content.

- It can double as a Keyword map.

- It aligns content with personas.

- It helps customers through their purchase funnel.

## **Content Mapping activity**

A Content Mapping Activity is divided into two sections as follows:
 
**1.** User/Buyer persona

**2.** Lifecycle Stages

### **User Persona**

Personas and content mapping go hand in hand. You can't create a useful, accurate content map without developing an in-depth user/buyer persona first. 

#### **What it is?**

- A user persona is a detailed description of your ideal audience. It helps you get to know your customers and understand what they know, want, and need.

- It help businesses understand and empathize with their customers so they can do a better job of acquiring and serving them.

- A persona is about perception. For example in the business world, for instance if a businessman wants others to think that he is very powerful and successful, he might drive a fancy car, buy a big house, wear expensive clothing, and talk down to people that he thinks are below him on the social ladder.

A buyer persona typically outlines the following characteristics of the ideal buyer:

- **Demographics:** It includes age, gender, income, location, family situation, income, education, etc.

- **Professional Role:** It mainly focuses on Industry, job title, company size

- **Values and Goals:**  What the user believe strongly in,
professional and personal goals, values, lifestyle details

- **Challenges:** What challenges the user is facing, pain points, fears, issues at work or home

- **Sources and Influences:** What are their favorite blogs, books, thought leaders, conferences

- **Buying Habits:** What objections they keep before buying, where from they buy, how long it takes them to buy, who makes the buying decisions.


#### **Sources to gain information**

While strategisisng you need to know what is currently trending in your area, what people are more curious about, which keyword will work best at that particular time. So the one strategising a content map for a particular website will do a research for the keywords and other important news to gain information in detail.
