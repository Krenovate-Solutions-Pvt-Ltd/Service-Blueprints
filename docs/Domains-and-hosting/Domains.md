# **Domain**
## **Domain Name**
A domain name is your website name. A domain name is the address where internet users can access your website. A domain name is used for finding and identifying computers on the Internet. Computers use IP addresses, which are a series of number. However, it is difficult for humans to remember strings of numbers. Because of this, domain names were developed and used to identify entities on the Internet rather than using IP addresses.

A domain name can be any combination of letters and numbers, and it can be used in combination of the various domain name extensions, such as .com, .net and more.

The domain name must be registered before you can use it. Every domain name is unique. No two websites can have the same domain name. For example if someone types in krenovate.com, it will go to Krenovate's website and no one else's.
## **URL**
A URL (*“Uniform Resource Locator”*) is a complete web address used to reach a particular web destination.
A URL has four major parts:

>**1. HTTPS / HTTP**

<!-- -->
>**2. TLD** 

<!-- -->
>**3. Domain** 

<!-- -->
>**4. Sub Domain**

### **1. HTTPS/HTTP** 
You should capture email IDs using simple sign up forms for newsletter of your company for all the people visiting your website. People who will be interested in your products or services will sign up, as they might be interested to get regular updates about your business. 

The internet has over 1.5 billion websites, the information and data on each website is fetched and presented to you by the **HTTP** (*Hyper transfer text protocol*) technology that is as old as the internet. The **HTTPS** (*Hyper transfer text protocol secure*) is a more secure way of fetching & presenting data and information on websites. 

The data and information on HTTPS websites is encrypted using *SSL certificates*. These certificates convert any data or information in an encrypted format, so that even if someone gets access to some confidential information data from the website it is an encrypted format and no one can perform any scam or fraud online by using such information. To give you a simple example, when you buy anything online by entering your credit card details, e-commerce websites use SSL certificates to convert the data you have entered to be saved in an encrypted format, so that no one can use your credit card details to do some fraud online shopping or scammy online purchases.

Let’s say you entered your credit card number as 
**1234 5678 9999 0000**,
all HTTPS websites will convert this data into an encrypted format like **‘kjbdy87343hkdh873837864hdwsdtrsdwte72328627362876826vsjhdwud67e228736287632’** 
And this encryption changes every time you enter any data on any HTTPS website.
## **HTTP vs HTTPS**
#### **HTTP** (*No encryption*)
    Data entered: 1234 5678 9999 0000   
    Data saved as: 1234 5678 9999 0000
#### **HTTPS** (*Encryption through SSL certificates*)
    Data entered: 1234 5678 9999 0000    
    Data saved as: nhnkqoayhgqlabgjmcieioegebsksbshs8782n9dybsjsi8eyey920jsn
Needless to say that you should avoid sharing any confidential data on a HTTP website. Also Google Chrome to safeguard and make people aware about non secure websites using HTTP only has started writing ‘unsecure’ just before their URL. Look at the image.

While websites using SSL certificate are marked as safe by Google Chrome, look at
the following image.

### **2. TLD**
Also known as the **top-level domain**. The most common used TLD is ‘.com’. TLDs are generally used as a reference to a geographic area or a type of community, group, organisation. For example, *‘.com.au’* will reflect that the website is run by an Australian organisation, similarly
*‘.edu’* is a TLD generally used by colleges, schools and educational institutes.

There are more than 1,000 TLDs available in the world. The following are the top 10 used TLDs in the world:
#### 1) .COM: 82.01 million
#### 2) .DE (Germany): 13.05 million
#### 3) .CN (China): 12.55 million
#### 4) .NET: 12.42 million
#### 5) .UK (United Kingdom): 7.83 million
#### 6) .ORG: 7.79 million
#### 7) .INFO: 5.24 million
#### 8) .NL (Netherlands): 3.5 million
#### 9) .EU (European Union): 2.98 million
#### 10) .RU (Russia): 2.31 million
So if you are launching a website for a business in Europe it makes more sense to launch it under the *.EU TLD*, because people in europe would be more accustomed to open websites with *.EU TLD*.
Also there are some TLDs available which directly represent a business category, like the
*.AGENCY TLD*, so if you are planning to open up an agency for any industry, it makes more sense to buy a domain name under the *.AGENCY TLD*.

### **3. Domain**
Kickstarting any business online with a website starts with a booking a domain name. Once you have shortlisted the right TLDs based on your business/organisation category the next step is to search and book the domain name for your online business. You should follow the following guidelines to book a domain name for your business.

1. Shortlist relevant TLDs
2. Prefer a single word for your domain name
3.   For example the official name of my organisation is ‘**Krenovate Solutions Pvt Ltd**’ but the website runs under the brand name ‘*Krenovate.com*’
4. ‘Godaddy’ does not have all TLDs available, book domains on 
[United Domains](https://www.uniteddomains.com/)
5. Book your domain name for extra TLDs (like .co, .co.in, .xyz, .work etc.), which are not very expensive, this will be helpful for bulk email marketing.
### **3. Sub Domains**
Apple has a very beautiful website, that anyone can visit by typing in the given 
[Apple link](https://www.apple.com/)
 for buying and finding information for all Apple products. On the other hand, customers of Apple, if they want any help or support for their old purchases have to visit [Apple customer support link](https://support.apple.com/).
Both websites (https://www.apple.com/) which is referred to as [Apple link](https://www.apple.com/) here and(https://support.apple.com/)which is referred to as [Apple customer support link](https://support.apple.com/) in this section run on the same domain name i.e. apple.com. These are actually two different websites for different set of users. Visitors of Apple.com and support.apple.com are absolutely different.Prospect or any person who wants to find out any information about Apple visits the main website [Apple link](https://www.apple.com/), while registered customers of Apple visit  [Apple customer support link](https://support.apple.com/) which is a subdomain of Apple.com for help and support on products and services.

Any person/organisation who has bought a domain name can create an unlimited number of subdomains without any extra cost. Subdomains help organisations to manage a similar set of users access relevant information on a separate independent website. Subdomains have the following advantages:

>#### 1. Specific website for specific stakeholders.
>#### 2. Easy to regulate and manage content and information for a specific set of users.
>#### 3. Performance of one website does not affect the other, so if one of the subdomain crashes, the others won’t get affected (if all our hosted on separate servers).
>#### 4. Designing and planning a website becomes more easy and sensible.
>#### 5. All subdomains can eventually run as individual entities.
>#### 6. Good for organisations which deal with seperate kind of stakeholders.

Please remember, creating subdomains for different products or services is not beneficial as subdomains are only helpful if you have multiple stakeholders. To be more clear, create subdomains only if you have different stakeholders like customers, vendors, suppliers, employees and prospective customers and that too if you cannot handle them on a single website.
