# **Hosting**
## **Introduction**

Web hosting is an online service that enables you to publish your website on the Internet. When you sign up for a web hosting service, you basically rent some space on a server where you can store all the files and data necessary for your website which can be accessed anytime through the internet to work properly.Hosting is done by the web hosts.

Web hosts are companies that rent out their services and technologies to host websites on the internet. Once the hosting company hosts your website, users can access it by typing in your web address (domain name) in their web browser. When they do this, their computer connects to the server your website is hosted on.

## **Servers**

Servers are machines that store and serve data on request. USB is a server, as it stores your data and when you attach it to a USB port it shows you the files and data in it. Similarly all machines that store data and serve it on request are servers.


Servers can be online and offline. Offline servers are your laptop, USB, mobile phones and anything that shows you data without using the internet. Online servers are similar machines which store information and data and are only accessible through the internet.


Online servers are provided by hosting providers, companies which are in the business of creating and managing online servers. For example, Godaddy is a hosting provider that offers a range of different types of online servers that you can use to store and run your websites and apps. All online servers have an IP address, which is used to access the information on that server.

-  Choose a ‘DATACENTER’, this step is important. You should always choose a datacenter which is geographically nearest to your prospective customers. For example, if you are building a website for users who stay in India, you should select ‘Bangalore’ as a datacenter. Having a datacenter in the same country helps to serve data more quickly to the people visiting the website, making your website experience better for your website visitors.
