##  **How Web Hosting works**

When you sign up for a web hosting service, you basically rent some space on a physical **server** where you can store all the files and data necessary for your website to work properly. 

### **Servers**

A server is a physical computer that runs without any interruption so that your website is available all the time for anyone who wants to see it. Your web host is responsible for keeping that server up and running, protecting it from malicious attacks, and transferring your content — such as text, images, files, etc. — from the server to your visitors’ browsers.

A server is a computer that connects other web users to your site from anywhere in the world. As the name implies, web hosting service providers have the servers, connectivity, and associated services to host websites. By offering a variety of hosting plans, they cover the spectrum of hosting needs, from small blogs and large organizations.

Simply put, all machines that store data and serve it on request are servers. For eg: laptop, USB, phones etc.

####    **Types of Servers**

Servers can be online and offline. 

**Offline servers** are your laptop, USB, mobile phones and anything that shows you data **without using the internet**. 

**Online servers** are similar machines which store information and data and are **only accessible through the internet**.

Online servers are provided by hosting providers, companies which are in the business of creating and managing online servers. For example, Godaddy is a hosting provider that offers a range of different types of online servers that you can use to store and run your websites and apps. All online servers have an IP address, which is used to access the information on that server.

##  **Types of Hosting**

Most web hosts offer different types of hosting so that they can serve the needs of different clients — whether you want to build a simple personal blog or own a large online business and are in a dire need of an intricate company website. Here are the most popular options available:

-   Shared hosting
-   VPS hosting
-   Cloud hosting
-   WordPress hosting
-   Dedicated hosting

For the sake of understanding, we will discuss the two most important options, namely, Shared Hosting and Cloud Hosting.

### **Shared Hosting**

With this type of hosting, your site shares a physical server with one or more other websites. Shared hosting allows multiple websites to utilize a single server. Usually, you’ll have no idea who or what websites you’re sharing the resources of a server with.

### **Cloud Hosting**

Cloud hosting is a type of web hosting which uses multiple different servers to balance the load and maximize uptime. Instead of using a single server, your website can tap into a “cluster” that uses resources from a centralized pool. Visualise the cloud as a web of different computers which are all interconnected. As more machines are hooked up to the network, more resources are added to the overall cloud.

### **Difference between Shared Hosting and Cloud Hosting**

In this section we will discuss the main difference between Shared and Cloud Hosting:

| **1.** Multiple websites are hosted on a single server.| **1.** Dedicated individual server<br>for each website. |
| **2.** All websites have a<br>common IP address. | **2.** Each website has an exclusive<br>IP address. |
| **3.** If the server crashes, all websites <br>go down together. | **3.** If the server crashes, only the website<br>hosted on it crashes, does not affect other websites. |
| **4.** If you buy shared hosting, you <br>get server space in a server that is also being used for other websites.| **4.** If you buy cloud hosting, you get server<br> space in a dedicated server that is exclusively being used for only your website. |
| **5.** You cannot make any technical changes to the server as it is shared. | **5.** You can make whatever technical<br>changes you want to perform in your cloud server. |
| **6.**  Good for simple business websites. | **6.** Good for e-commerce and product based websites.
| **7.** Prices are generally affordable and cheap. | **7.** Prices are dynamic based on server usage, they go up with the no. of users on your website. |
