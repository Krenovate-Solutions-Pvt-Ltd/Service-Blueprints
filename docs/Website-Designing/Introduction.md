# **Website Designing**

**_"Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works."_** -Steve Jobs

## **What is Web Designing**

- It refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than software development.

- An effective website design should fulfil its intended function by conveying its particular message whilst simultaneously engaging the visitor. Several factors such as consistency, colours, typography, imagery, simplicity and functionality all contribute to good website design.

## **Designing Process**

In order to design, build, and launch your website, it's important to follow these steps:

**1. PLANNING**

It is the most important because what’s decided and mapped here sets the stage for the entire project. This stage also requires client interaction and accompanying attention to detail.

- Requirements analysis
- Project charter
- Site map
- Contracts that define roles, copyright and financial points
- Gain access to servers and build folder structure
- Determine required software and resources (stock photography, fonts, etc.)

**2. DESIGN**

This stage involves moving the information outlined in the planning stage further into reality. The main deliverables are a documented site structure and more importantly a visual representation. Upon completion of this phase, the website should more or less have taken shape, but for the absence of the content and special features.

- Wireframe and design elements planning
- Mock-ups based on requirements analysis
- Review and approval cycle
- Slice and code valid XHTML/CSS 

**3. DEVELOPMENT**

It involves the bulk of the programming work, as well as loading content.
 
- Build development framework
- Code templates for each page type
- Develop and test special features and interactivity
- Fill with content
- Test and verify links and functionality

**4. LAUNCH**

The purpose of the this phase is to prepare the website for public viewing. This requires final polishing of design elements, deep testing of interactivity and features and most of all, a consideration of the user experience.

- Polishing
- Transfer to live server
- Testing
- Final cross-browser check 

**5. POST-LAUNCH**

Business re-enters the picture at this point as you take care of all the little tasks related to closing the project. Packaging source files, providing instructions for use and any required training occurs at this time. You can't leave the project with a closed door, communicate that you’re available for future maintenance and are committed to ongoing support.

- Hand off to client
- Provide documentation and source files
- Project close, final documentation
