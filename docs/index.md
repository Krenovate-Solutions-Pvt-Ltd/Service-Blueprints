# **Service Blueprints**

**_“ I have learned that I still have a lot to learn ”_** – Maya Angelou


Training is an ongoing process. Employees don’t just learn at training sessions, they engage with tutorials, webinars, onscreen guidance and learning apps. Training has become more and more a process, rather than an event. So a service blueprint becomes an integral part of the training process at Krenovate.

A **service blueprint** is a stepwise guide/structure/book of instructions which is designed to ensure consistency and uniformity in the presentation of the content which includes the processes and the other information about Krenovate. 

All efforts have been made to map out (in detail) the steps involved in a service process, in order to make it easier to design a new process or to document and improve an existing one.

**This service blueprint has been created to benefit the below section of users at Krenovate:**

-   New recruits
-   Business Analysts
-   Sales consultants
-   Project Managers
-   Development team
-   Design team
-   Digital Marketing team

**Benefits of the Service Blueprints:**

-   To empower Krenovate to optimize all its service processes.
-   Scalability and flexibility: To show high level of overviews and intricate steps.
-   Cross-functionality and knowledge transferability: Employees and managers in the long run, can easily lose sight of the bigger picture or how each action affects other departments, fellow employees, or even the customer. Service blueprints clarify interactions and reduce siloes.
-   Failure analysis: Once the structure and role is defined, its easier to diagnose what's going wrong. 
-   To create a visible structure for implementing and achieving operational goals.
-   To foster better communication between all emloyees.
-   Keeping all the service processess free from unnecessary complications and redundancies.
