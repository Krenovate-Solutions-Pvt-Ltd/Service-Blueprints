# **Service Blueprints**

**_“ I have learned that I still have a lot to learn ”_** – Maya Angelou


Training is an ongoing process. Employees don’t just learn at training sessions, they engage with tutorials, webinars, onscreen guidance and learning apps. Training has become more and more a process, rather than an event. So a service blueprint becomes an integral part of the training process at Krenovate.

A service blueprint is a stepwise guide/structure/book of instructions which is designed to ensure consistency and uniformity in the presentation of the content which includes the processes and the other information about Krenovate. This service blueprint can be followed by a new recruit as well as the existing employee(including Business Analyst, sales consultant, project manager, development team, design team and digital marketing team.

This service blueprint can be used to -

-	Introduce the subject matter prior to training.
-	Serve as an outline to be followed  to achieve the desired goals.
-	A reference document post training.
