All websites run on different servers.The domain name is linked and attached to a particular server through the DNS.The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources. Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device. How DNS works \u00b6 The domain name system maps the name we use to locate a website to the IP address that a computer uses to locate a website. Every server has a public IP address by which it is identified. For example the server IP address for Krenovate.com is 64.90.44.34. It is difficult to remember an IP Address, and that is why it becomes necessary to attach this IP address to the domain name of the organisation. Humans are inclined to remember names rather than numbers. DNS system allows us to manage multiple things through the different set of records available in the DNS system. We will discuss the most important records in the DNS, which are as follows: 1. Nameservers 2. A records 3. CNAME Records 4. MX Records 5. TXT Records We can access the DNS records of our domain by logging into our domain management account. We generally use Godaddy to buy domains, the below image is a snapshot of the account we have at Godaddy to manage the domains we own. It has various domains bought by our organisation. If we look closely, in front of every domain name we will find a prominent button with the CTA \u2018DNS\u2019. By clicking this we will reach the DNS records of the respective domain name. 1. Nameservers \u00b6 Nameservers help us identify the hosting service for the particular domain name. For example, if we have to host a domain on Dreamhost which is a web hosting service, we have to point the domain to Dreamhost using the Dreamhost nameservers. Each domain is pointed to a minimum of two nameservers. Nameservers are always managed from the domain management account. Look at the following image, which is a snapshot of the nameservers of Krenovate.com. As we can see in the above image nameservers of Krenovate.com point to Dreamhost, making it clear that www.krenovate.com is hosted on Dreamhost. Nameservers are generally written in the format \u2018ns1.servername.com\u2019. Also the particular nameservers help us identify the place from where we can manage the DNS records. DNS records are always available and can be modified from the hosting service provider of the website. If we have to make any changes to the DNS records of Krenovate.com, we will have to do the same in our Dreamhost Hosting Account. Refer to the following scenarios to get a better uderstanding and clarity on the same. Scenario 1 - Domain Provider and Hosting Provider are the same.This simply means that you bought a domain on Godaddy and have also bought hosting services from Godaddy itself. Scenario 2 - Domain Provider and Hosting Provider are different This is the scenario of Krenovate.com, the domain name Krenovate.com has been bought and managed on Godaddy , while the website Krenovate.com is hosted on Dreamhost . The following table will help you understand where you will manage your DNS records and nameservers in the aforementioned scenarios. Domain Management Scenario 1 Scenario 2 Nameservers The nameservers are always managed through domain provider account. Godaddy Godaddy DNS Records The DNS records are always managed through hosting provider account. Goddady Dreamhost Scenario 1 \u00b6 The following image will show you that you can see and manage both nameservers and DNS records from your Godaddy account. Scenario 2 \u00b6 The following image will show you that you can only see and manage nameservers from your Godaddy account and it says DNS records cannot be displayed as nameservers are pointed to Dreamhost. 2. A Records \u00b6 The A Record is the most important record as it connects the domain name to the relevant IP address of the hosting server. The following image will show you how to add or edit an A Record in your DNS Records. A Record has the following elements: Type of Record - A Record Host - @ The host name for the record, without the domain name. Points to - The IP address of hosting server TTL - Time to go live 3. CNAME Records \u00b6 CNAME Records are used for managing the subdomains of a website. The following image will show you how to add or edit a CNAME Record in the DNS Records. A typical CNAME Record has the following elements: Type of Record - CNAME Record Host - The name you want to keep for your subdomain Points to - The IP Address of hosting server of the subdomain TTL - Time to go live 4. MX Records \u00b6 MX Records are used for managing the email services of a domain. For example, email ID sharmapuneet@krenovate.com has been running on GSuite, the business version of Gmail. The following image will show you how to add or edit an MX Record in the DNS Records. A typical MX Record has the following elements: Type of Record - MX Record Host - @ (This means that you are running email services on your domain name) Points to - The hosting address of email provider (In this case the hosting provider is Google) Priority - Generally email providers will share multiple MX records with you, and a priority for each of them as well. TTL - Time to go live 5. TXT Records \u00b6 The TXT Records are text records and generally used for verifying ownership of a domain name. Many online service providers to activate their services on your domain name, instruct you to add a custom and unique TXT Record. For example to activate Gsuite on our domain for emailing, we have to add the following TXT Record. A typical TXT Record has the following elements: Type of Record - TXT Record Host - @ (This means that you are pointing to your own domain name) TXT Value - The unique text record shared by some other organisation TTL - Time to go live","title":"Domains Name System (DNS)"},{"location":"Domains-and-hosting/DNS/#domain-name-systems","text":"","title":"Domain Name Systems"},{"location":"Domains-and-hosting/DNS/#what-is-dns","text":"DNS is the control panel for the domain names we buy on websites like Godaddy.

It is the address where internet users can access the website and also find and identify computers on the Internet. Computers use IP addresses, which are a series of number. However, it is difficult for humans to remember strings of numbers. Because of this, these were developed and used to identify entities on the Internet rather than using IP addresses. It can be any combination of letters and numbers, and can be used in combination of various domain name extensions, such as .com, .net and more. It must be registered before one can use it. No two websites can have the same domain name as it is unique. For example if someone types in krenovate.com, it will go to Krenovate's website and no one else's. URL \u00b6 A URL ( \u201cUniform Resource Locator\u201d ) is a complete web address used to reach a particular web destination. A URL has four major parts: 1. HTTPS / HTTP 2. TLD 3. Domain 4. Sub Domain 1. HTTPS/HTTP \u00b6 One can capture email IDs using simple sign up forms for newsletter of the company for all the people visiting their website. People who will be interested in the products or services will sign up, as they might be interested to get regular updates about the business. The internet has over 1.5 billion websites, the information and data on each website is fetched and presented to us by the HTTP ( Hyper transfer text protocol ) technology that is as old as the internet. The HTTPS ( Hyper transfer text protocol secure ) is a more secure way of fetching & presenting data and information on websites. The data and information on HTTPS websites is encrypted using SSL certificates . These certificates convert any data or information in an encrypted format, so that even if someone gets access to some confidential information data from the website it is an encrypted format and no one can perform any scam or fraud online by using such information. To give a simple example, when we buy anything online by entering our credit card details, e-commerce websites use SSL certificates to convert the data we have entered into an encrypted format, so that no one can use our credit card details for any scammy online purchases. Let\u2019s say our credit card number is 1234 5678 9999 0000 , all HTTPS websites will convert this data into an encrypted format like \u2018kjbdy87343hkdh873837864hdwsdtrsdwte72328627362876826vsjhdwud67e228736287632\u2019 And this encryption changes every time we enter any data on any HTTPS website.

Also use Google Chrome to safeguard and make people aware about the websites which are not secure. Check the image below. While websites using SSL certificate are marked as safe by Google Chrome, look at the following image. 2. TLD \u00b6 Also known as the top-level domain . The most common used TLD is \u2018.com\u2019. TLDs are generally used as a reference to a geographic area or a type of community, group, organisation. For example, \u2018.com.au\u2019 will reflect that the website is run by an Australian organisation, similarly \u2018.edu\u2019 is a TLD generally used by colleges, schools and educational institutes. There are more than 1,000 TLDs available in the world. Top 10 used TLDs in the world: \u00b6 1) .COM: 82.01 million 2) .DE (Germany): 13.05 million 3) .CN (China): 12.55 million 4) .NET: 12.42 million 5) .UK (United Kingdom): 7.83 million 6) .ORG: 7.79 million 7) .INFO: 5.24 million 8) .NL (Netherlands): 3.5 million 9) .EU (European Union): 2.98 million 10) .RU (Russia): 2.31 million So if we are launching a website for a business in Europe it makes more sense to launch it under the .EU TLD , because people in europe would be more accustomed to open websites with .EU TLD . Also there are some TLDs available which directly represent a business category, like the .AGENCY TLD , so if we are planning to open up an agency for any industry, it makes more sense to buy a domain name under the .AGENCY TLD . TLD's used in world Top 10 used TLDs in the world 3. Domain \u00b6 Kickstarting any business online with a website starts with booking a domain name. Once we have shortlisted the right TLDs based on our business/organisation category the next step is to search and book the domain name. We should follow the guidelines given below to book a domain name. Shortlist relevant TLDs Prefer a single word for our domain name For example the official name of our organisation is \u2018 Krenovate Solutions Pvt Ltd \u2019 but the website runs under the brand name \u2018 Krenovate.com \u2019 \u2018Godaddy\u2019 does not have all TLDs available, book domains on United Domains We can book domain name for extra TLDs (like .co, .co.in, .xyz, .work etc.), which are not very expensive, this will be helpful for bulk email marketing. 4. Sub Domains \u00b6 Apple has a very beautiful website, that anyone can visit by typing in the given Apple link for buying and finding information for all Apple products. On the other hand, customers of Apple, if they want any help or support for their old purchases have to visit Apple customer support link . Both websites ( https://www.apple.com/ ) which is referred to as Apple link here and( https://support.apple.com/)which is referred to as Apple customer support link in this section run on the same domain name i.e. apple.com. These are actually two different websites for different set of users. Visitors of Apple.com and support.apple.com are absolutely different.Prospect or any person who wants to find out any information about Apple visits the main website Apple link , while registered customers of Apple visit Apple customer support link which is a subdomain of Apple.com for help and support on products and services. Any person/organisation who has bought a domain name can create an unlimited number of subdomains without any extra cost. Subdomains help organisations to manage a similar set of users access relevant information on a separate independent website. Advantages of sub domain \u00b6 Specific website for specific stakeholders. Easy to regulate and manage content and information for a specific set of users. Performance of one website does not affect the other, so if one of the subdomain crashes, the others won\u2019t get affected (if all our hosted on separate servers). Designing and planning a website becomes more easy and sensible. All subdomains can eventually run as individual entities. Good for organisations which deal with seperate kind of stakeholders. Please remember, creating subdomains for different products or services is not beneficial as subdomains are only helpful if we have multiple stakeholders. To be more clear, create subdomains only if you have different stakeholders like customers, vendors, suppliers, employees and prospective customers and that too if it cannot be handled on a single website.","title":"Domains"},{"location":"Domains-and-hosting/Domains/#domain","text":"","title":"Domain"},{"location":"Domains-and-hosting/Domains/#domain-name","text":"A domain name is the website name.

When you sign up for a web hosting service, you basically rent some space on a server where you can store all the files and data necessary for your website which can be accessed anytime through the internet to work properly.Hosting is done by the web hosts. Web hosts are companies that rent out their services and technologies to host websites on the internet. Once the hosting company hosts your website, users can access it by typing in your web address (domain name) in their web browser. When they do this, their computer connects to the server your website is hosted on. Servers \u00b6 Servers are machines that store and serve data on request. USB is a server, as it stores your data and when you attach it to a USB port it shows you the files and data in it. Similarly all machines that store data and serve it on request are servers. Servers can be online and offline. Offline servers are your laptop, USB, mobile phones and anything that shows you data without using the internet. Online servers are similar machines which store information and data and are only accessible through the internet. Online servers are provided by hosting providers, companies which are in the business of creating and managing online servers. For example, Godaddy is a hosting provider that offers a range of different types of online servers that you can use to store and run your websites and apps. All online servers have an IP address, which is used to access the information on that server. Difference between Shared amd Cloud hosting \u00b6 Shared Hosting Cloud Hosting 1. Multiple websites are hosted on a single server. 1. Dedicated individual server for each website. 2. All websites have a common IP address. 2. Each website has an exclusive IP address. 3. If the server crashes, all websites go down together. 3. If the server crashes, only the website hosted on it crashes, does not affect other websites. 4.
