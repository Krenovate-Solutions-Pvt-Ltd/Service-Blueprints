In simple words, the customer lifecycle describes the various stages a consumer goes through before, during and after they complete a transaction. Lifecycle Stages \u00b6 A customer journey of fulfilling his/her needs/wants goes through a cyclic pattern of stages. These stages are known as the Lifecycle stages. Primarily, there are 5 stages of the User Lifecycle. We will discuss these stages in a detailed manner below: Awareness \u00b6 Awareness is the first phase of the User lifecycle. This phase is considered to be the most important as this is the point where a consumer becomes aware of any services offered. Typically, all consumers start at this phase as they may learn about your services before engaging with you. This is when the consumer first becomes aware of the existence of your brand, product, or service. Awareness content or top-of-funnel content attracts new audiences to your brand/services and helps prospects find answers to the questions they ask when they realize they have a need. Awareness content typically includes: Blog posts Infographics Videos Buying guides Checklists Social media posts Interactive content Engagement \u00b6 Once the consumer is aware of you, they\u2019ll start seeking out your marketing content by following you on social media, signing up for your emails, etc. In addition, they\u2019ll start paying attention to what others are saying about you and how you respond to service requests and complaints. Brands that publicly engage and provide customer service through social media have an advantage at this stage. Engagement content keeps audiences interested in your brand so that when they are ready to buy, they choose your company. Engagement content typically includes: Email newsletters Blog posts nfographics Videos Social media posts Interactive content Evaluation \u00b6 In the evaluation stage, the consumer has discovered your business and is now collecting information to weigh the pros and cons of your offerings. Sometimes, this assessment is against your competition. Other times, the consumer is contemplating how well your solutions fit their needs whether that be their budget, the outcomes they\u2019re looking for by using your offerings, or other factors like ease of use. It\u2019s at this stage that a consumer might enter your sales funnel as a prospect or lead. Evaluation content or middle-of-funnel marketing content helps inform customers as they decide if your brand, products, and services are a fit for what they need. Evaluation content typically includes: Landing pages Marketing case studies Product and service lists Data sheets Reviews and testimonials Webinars E-books and white papers Purchase \u00b6 Here, we arrive at the point where a prospect takes the final decision and becomes a customer. They\u2019ve evaluated your offerings and decided to buy from you. But just because a customer reaches this stage does not mean the purchase is guaranteed. Tt\u2019s possible for a customer to abandon their selection in your website\u2019s digital shopping cart.

You can\u2019t create a useful and accurate content map without developing an in-depth buyer persona first.\" What is a User Persona \u00b6 A user persona is a semi-fictional character created to represent different customer types that use a company\u2019s products or services. They are semi-fictional, in that they are not a specific individual, but their characteristics should be gathered from observation of real-world users. A user persona is a detailed description of your ideal audience. It helps you get to know your customers and understand what they know, want, and need. User personas are written as if the individual were real, but at the same time, they reflect common attributes across a cohort of people. A well-researched, analytical and data-driven user persona is hugely beneficial to a company's product development, sales strategies and marketing campaigns. The function of user personas is to ensure that company initiatives (such as marketing or product development), are done with the user very firmly in mind.

Benefits of building User Personas \u00b6 Below are a few benefits of building/creating User Personas: It helps you to understand your user's needs, experiences, behaviours and goals. It can help you to recognise that different people have different needs and expectations. It can also help you to identify with the user your are designing for. It makes the design task at hand less complex. It guides the ideation process. Personas can help to achieve the goal of creating a good user experience for the target audience/user group. Steps in Building User Personas \u00b6 A user persona compiles traits to create a representation of the ideal target audience/user. The building exercise helps you to visualize your ideal user and the process they go through on their way to becoming your customer. Let's look at the steps in building the User Persona: Determine Method of Research : The first step is to collect information about your target audience.This is where the Data Collection methods come into consideration. Identify Patterns : Once you gather some data to analyze, it\u2019s time to identify trends. It\u2019s time to take a closer look at tagged data to see if overlap emerge naturally. Create a Persona : Once you\u2019re done with collecting data and segmentation, it is finally time to start creating a persona. Inside this section, you should include: Details about the user\u2019s education, lifestyle, interests, values, goals, needs, limitations, desires, attitudes, and patterns of behaviour. Add a few fictional personal details to make the persona a realistic character. Give each of your personas a name. Create 1\u20132-pages of descriptions for each persona. Add End Goal : The end goal is the motivating factor that inspires action, and answers the question: \"what do users want or need to accomplish by using your product?\" End goals are the main driving forces of your users and determine what the persona wants or needs to fulfill. Add a Scenario : A scenario is a \u201cday-in-the-life\u201d narrative that describes how a persona would interact with your product in a particular context to achieve his or her end goal(s). The scenario usually defines when, where, and how the narrative takes place. They are typically written from the perspective of the persona and describe use cases that may happen in the future. Below is a sample User persona template: Below are some examples of how different User Persona look like: Who is Target Audience \u00b6 Target audience refers to the specific group of consumers most likely to want your product or service, and therefore, the group of people who should see your ad campaigns/websites/services.

To better understand how to create content that connects benefits to consumer needs. Increase conversions (thanks to 1 & 2) Below factors play an important role in defining a target audience: Personal Factors \u00b6 Personal factors can affect the consumer behavior. Some of the important personal factors that influence the buying behavior are: lifestyle, economic situation, occupation, age, personality and self concept. Demographic Factors \u00b6 The below factors constitute the demographic profile of the target audience: Age Gender Location Hobbies Income Education Level Profession Marital status Who they trust What they read/watch Geographic Factors \u00b6 Each geographic region represents specific culture and differs in terms of needs, preference, habits, usage rates, and uses of products/services. Clothing, residence, food, vehicle, etc., are determined by regional climate and culture. Customer preferences change based on geographic location. The following are some examples of geographic factors: Region : by continent, country, state, or even neighbourhood. Size of metropolitan area : segmented according to size of population. Population density : often classified as urban, suburban, rural. Climate : according to weather patterns common to certain geographic regions. Psycological Factors \u00b6 There are four important psychological factors affecting the consumer buying behavior. These are: perception motivation learning beliefs and attitudes Interests/Behavioral Factors \u00b6 The technique involves gathering data from a variety of sources about the potential customer\u2019s online browsing and shopping behaviors. This information helps create websites that are relevant to that specific user\u2019s habits and interests, which the publisher can then display in that visitor\u2019s web browser. These factors include: Frequently visited pages Webpage viewing times Clicked Ads and links Personal web searches Webpage Element interactions Transaction Progress Purchase Histories Time gaps between visits Technological Factors \u00b6 With technological advances happening everyday, the customer is also changing. It is important to understand how the technology is influencing customer behaviour, thinking and experiences in order to grow regardless of all these factors. Below are some of the factors that need to be considered: Decreased customer attention : Nowadays, there is way too much content for people to consume which in turn is causing \"content overload\" in everyone's lives. This results in a decreased attention span of the target audience. Need for personalisation : Technology has made it so easy and simple to create an online pressence for any business, which in turn again overloads the customer with irrelevant content. To provide a good customer experience, it is important to identify target audience and then personalise content and services accordingly. The ease of access to info : A few years ago, customers made buying decisions based on news, advertisements, past experience or referrals from other people. However, technology has changed this. As per studies, 61% of customers use search engines to aid them in product research before they can make a buying decision. Hence, it is very important to show extremely relevant info about your services and products and make improvements based on reviews and ratings from past customers. Brand trust and likability : Technological advances has made the customer smart enough to make decisions based on their research and then trust a brand. To influence customer behaviour for the benefit of business, it is advised to to improve your online presence and reputation. Trustworthiness can be improved by including reviews, ratings and testimonials by past customers. Customer expectations have gone up : Technological advances have provided too many choices for the customer which in turn has increased their expectations. But, too many choices can confuse the customer and prevent them from taking a proper decision about a product/service. So, it is important to provide the customer with products/services which meet the customer expectations. What are the Needs/Wants/Desires of the Target Audience \u00b6 The needs, wants and demands of the customers/target audience vary greatly. They vary by target market, cultural and social norms and even market conditions. The important part is to know what they are, what your customers are willing and able to pay for and offer them what makes the most sense for that particular situation. It often comes down to effective listening and then matching your products and services to what your customer truly asking for. A customer need is a consumer\u2019s desire for a product\u2019s or service\u2019s specific benefit, whether that be functional or emotional. The emotional benefit tends to be a stronger driver for consumers, as functional benefits can be easily copied by competitors. In short, needs are things that satisfy the basic requirement. In order for a business to be successful, it is key to identify and fulfil customers\u2019 needs. There are four main customer needs that an entrepreneur or small business must consider. These are: Price : Price is how much a business charges for its product or service. Customers want a fair price when purchasing a product or service. Usually, low prices will draw in many customers, although people ultimately want value for money. Quality : Quality relates to the standard of the product or service being offered. Customers always expect some level of quality, no matter how much they pay for a product or service. Choice : Choice is very important \u2013 many businesses have a range of products and/or services available to suit different groups of customers. Customers have different needs and desires when buying items. They might want different styles or sizes, or even completely different products altogether. For example, a clothing business may need to stock a range of styles and sizes. Convenience : Convenience relates to something being easier, quicker or generally less hassle for customers. And for this the customers/consumers are often willing to pay more. Read more about customer needs here A consumer want is the desire for products or services that are not necessary, but which consumers wish for. Wants are requests directed to specific types of items. A consumer demands are wants for specific products that are backed up by an ability and willingness to buy them.

Building content maps is the first step towards making a good website. It acts as a blueprint of your website. It allows you and your team to be organized and visualize what the site will become. It is a valuable tool when you are working with a web design company to produce your website. Creating a content map helps you understand: Where in the purchase funnel your content engages customers How your content helps customers get what they need at each stage How you can guide customers through the customer journey more effectively What is Content Mapping? \u00b6 Content mapping is a visual technique that will help you organize and understand the content of a website. Content Mapping focuses on how each piece of the content strategically relates to and supports the customer/client journey. It helps us to relate and connect to each of the phases/steps in a customer journey and helps us to deliver better and meet the needs of our target audience. Content mapping takes into account the characteristics of the person who will be consuming the content and their lifecycle stage. Three Pillars of Content Mapping \u00b6 To create an effective website you need to keep in mind these three pillars of content mapping which are as follows: Right Content \u00b6 This means creating valuable content for the users/customers/clients visiting your website. For example if you have build a website for fashion and clothing you have to put the content for the same and not for health and fitness because if users are visiting a website for fashion and clothing they should be shown content relevant to fashion and clothing and not health and fitness.That will make more sense to them. Right People \u00b6 People who visit your website will be generally from differet age groups, interests and needs. By 'right people' it means if you have build a website for women clothing and showing content for men fashion trends and sales on men wear it will not generate good sales for women clothing as your content is not specific for the people you have defined. Right Time \u00b6 By right time we do not mean that your website should have different content on different dates and time. By this we meant that a user/client goes through different stages before coming to a decision. For example Mr. A has to buy a shirt and he is gathering the information for the same from different websites. So he is in the process of getting details but he visits a website whhich is showing him there is a 30% discount for the same. At that particular 'gathering the information' stage he is getting the irrelevant content which he may require later. So it becomes very important for organisations to create the content based on the lifecycle stage of the person visiting the website. Benefits of Content Mapping \u00b6 Content mapping has various benefits as discussed below: It helps you understand your customer needs, goals and questions. It gives you an overview of all the content you have which helps you avoid creating redundant content and hihglights opportunities to reuse or repurpose existing content. It helps you get the most out of your content : Content mapping makes sure that every piece of content is created with a purpose and is fully optimized to serve that purpose. It helps with technology decisions : By having a good vision as to the direction and potential requirements of the site\u2019s content, we can make wise decisions at the start about the technologies we\u2019ll use, and make sure that the content management system we choose will meet the needs of our content. By being able to visualize your content, content mapping helps quickly spot gaps and opportunities. Building a Content Map \u00b6 In order to get started with content mapping, here are some things that need to be followed: Data Collection : This involves content research about market size, competitior, users, trends etc. User Personas : These are great for understanding the target audience, style trends, user desires etc. User Lifecycle : This is the who, what, why, when and how. Conclusion \u00b6 In the end, Content mapping makes your site about your customer, not about your company. Once that happens, your customers will start trusting your company because you make it about them - their needs and their questions; you understand and solve their problems. In return, they will give you their support, trust, and their business.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Content-Mapping/Introduction/#introduction","text":"","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Content-Mapping/Introduction/#what-is-a-content-map","text":"A content map is a plan to deliver the right content, to the right people, at the right time.

Create a buyer persona to understand your audience. \u00b6 A buyer/user persona typically outlines the following characteristics of the ideal buyer: Demographics: It includes age, gender, income, location, family situation, income, education, etc. Professional Role: It mainly focuses on Industry, job title, company size Values and Goals: What the user believe strongly in, professional and personal goals, values, lifestyle details Challenges: What challenges the user is facing, pain points, fears, issues at work or home Sources and Influences: What are their favorite blogs, books, thought leaders, conferences Buying Habits: What objections they keep before buying, where from they buy, how long it takes them to buy, who makes the buying decisions. Check out the image given below: Step 2. Document the journey your customer takes on their way to doing business with you. \u00b6 Once you have a clarity of who your ideal customer is, the content mapping process will be easier. You can use what you know about your ideal buyer to create a customer journey map that illustrates the path that person takes on their way to doing business with you. User Journey It also focuses on customer experiences at each stage of the marketing funnel. It may document the details for each phase. Customer Actions: What the customer is doing like performing a Google search, visiting a website etc. Customer Questions and Thoughts: What the customer is thinking about price, competitors, the offering\u2019s ability to solve problems, etc. Branded Touch Points: The branded customer platforms or interactions the customer experiences visiting your website, visiting a physical store location, speaking with customer services reps, etc. Brand Opportunities: What your brand can offer to customers to help and support them based on their actions, questions, thoughts, and the touch points they experience in that phase of the marketing funnel. After laying out the customer journey it\u2019s more clear what content you should create to attract, nurture, and guide customers during their journey. Step 3. Understand what content works best in each phase of the customer journey. \u00b6 Awareness content or top-of-funnel content attracts new audiences to your brand and helps prospects find answers to the questions they ask when they have a requirement. Engagement content keeps audiences interested in your brand so that when they are ready to buy, they choose your company. Evaluation content or middle-of-funnel marketing content helps inform customers as they decide if your brand, products, and services are a fit for what they require. Purchase content or bottom-of-funnel content is what customers interact with when they are ready to buy. It targets buyer keywords and helps customers feel confident in making their purchase. Post-purchase content supports customers after their purchase and also re-engages and remarkets to them to bring them back into the purchase funnel. Step 4. Create a catalog of the content you have. \u00b6 Perform a content audit and create a catalog of all the content you have which will prevent you from creating duplicate or redundant content assets. List each piece of content and relevant details as given in the image below: Refer the below link to get more info about creating catalog: https://blog.alexa.com/use-content-audit-template-assess-measure-plan-future/ Step 5. Map existing content to relevant phases of the customer journey. \u00b6 The things you should consider while filling your content map: The type of content As mentioned earlier, certain types of content work better in certain phases of the customer journey. Look at the type of content and decide where it best aligns with the phases of your content map. The content\u2019s conversion point As you consider where the content belongs in the map, also look at what the content tells the audience to do next. Make sure the call to action at the end of the content guides the customer to the next phase of the buyer\u2019s journey. The quality of the content Not all of your existing content may belong in your content map. If you find that the quality of an existing piece of content is low, don\u2019t use it in your content mapping. Leave it out and make a note that it could be revised later. Step 6. Create targeted content for gaps in your content map. \u00b6 Identify parts of your funnel that have inadequate/shallow content and create a plan for filling those gaps.

It is a standard protocol that helps Internet users discover websites using human readable addresses. Like a phonebook which lets you look up the name of a person and discover their number, DNS lets you type the address of a website and automatically discover the Internet Protocol (IP) address for that website. In other words: DNS connects URLs with their IP address. With DNS, it\u2019s possible to type words instead of a string of numbers into a browser, allowing people to search for websites and send emails using familiar names. When you search for a domain name in a browser, it sends a query over the internet to match the domain with its corresponding IP. Once located, it uses the IP to retrieve the website\u2019s content. Most impressively, this whole process takes just milliseconds. Few examples: the domain name www.ns1.com , translates to the IP address 104.20.48.182 the domain name www.amazon.com is translated to machine readable IP address 192.0.2.44 We can also define DNS as the control panel for the domain names we buy on websites like Godaddy. What is DNS - Video Tutorial More about DNS Uses of DNS \u00b6 The classic use of DNS is to translate the domain name in a URL into a corresponding IP address. But DNS has many more uses - it underlies many other forms of Internet communication: Resolving names of World Wide Web (www) sites Routing messages to email servers and webmail services Connecting app servers, databases and middleware within a web application Virtual Private Networks (VPN) Peer-to-peer sharing programs Multiplayer games Instant messaging and online meeting services Communication between IoT devices, gateways and servers How DNS works \u00b6 The process of DNS resolution involves converting a hostname (such as www.amazon.com ) into a computer-friendly IP address (such as 192.0.2.44). An IP address is given to each device on the Internet, and that address is necessary to find the appropriate Internet device - like a street address is used to find a particular home. When a user wants to load a webpage, a translation must occur between what a user types into their web browser (amazon.com) and the machine-friendly address necessary to locate the amazon.com webpage. Below image shows how exactly a DNS works: How DNS works - Video Tutorial How to access DNS records \u00b6 We can access the DNS records of our domain by logging into our domain management account. At Krenovate, we generally use Godaddy to buy domains.The below image is a snapshot of the account we have at Godaddy to manage the domains we own. It has various domains bought by our organisation. If we look closely, in front of every domain name we will find a prominent button with the CTA \u2018DNS\u2019. By clicking this we will reach the DNS records of the respective domain name. Records in the DNS System \u00b6 DNS system allows us to manage multiple things through the different set of records available in the DNS system. We will discuss the most important records in the DNS, which are as follows: 1. Nameservers 2. A records 3. CNAME Records 4. MX Records 5. TXT Records Nameservers \u00b6 A nameserver is a specialized server on the Internet that handles queries or questions from your local computer, about the location of a domain name\u2019s various services. Simply put, a nameserver helps browsers make connections between URLs and websites. They\u2019re incredibly important, as without them, we would have to memorize IP addresses in order to access websites. A nameserver maintains a directory of domain names that match certain IP addresses. In other words, it\u2019s where the DNS server records for your domain are stored, allowing you to decide which hosting providers controls your webspace and email. This process works so quickly that it\u2019s almost never noticeable. You simply type in a URL, the nameserver lets your browser know where that website is located, and the desired page loads. Nameservers help us identify the hosting service for the particular domain name. For example, if we have to host a domain on \"Dreamhost\" which is a web hosting service, we have to point the domain to Dreamhost using the Dreamhost nameservers. Each domain is pointed to a minimum of two nameservers. Nameservers are always managed from the domain management account. Look at the following image, which is a snapshot of the nameservers of Krenovate.com As we can see in the above image nameservers of Krenovate.com point to Dreamhost, making it clear that www.krenovate.com is hosted on Dreamhost. Nameservers are generally written in the format \u2018ns1.servername.com\u2019. Also, the particular nameservers help us identify the place from where we can manage the DNS records. DNS records are always available and can be modified from the hosting service provider of the website. If we have to make any changes to the DNS records of Krenovate.com, we will have to do the same in our Dreamhost Hosting Account. The domain provider and the hosting service provider can be same or two different entities for every website. We will discuss both the cases one by one for a better understanding: The following table will help you understand where you will manage your DNS records and nameservers in the below mentioned scenarios. Domain Management Scenario 1 Scenario 2 Nameservers The nameservers are always managed through domain provider account. Godaddy Godaddy DNS Records The DNS records are always managed through hosting provider account. Godaddy Dreamhost Scenario 1 \u00b6 In this case, the Domain Provider and Hosting Provider are the same.This simply means that you bought a domain on Godaddy and have also bought hosting services from Godaddy itself. In the below image, you can see and manage both nameservers and DNS records from your Godaddy account. Scenario 2 \u00b6 In this case, Domain Provider and Hosting Provider are different. This is the scenario of Krenovate.com , the domain name Krenovate.com has been bought and managed on Godaddy , while the website Krenovate.com is hosted on Dreamhost . The following image will show you that you can only see and manage nameservers from your Godaddy account and it says DNS records cannot be displayed as nameservers are pointed to Dreamhost. A Records \u00b6 The A (Address) Record is the most important record as it points your domain name to the relevant IP address. The following image will show you how to add or edit an A Record in your DNS Records. A Record has the following elements: Type of Record - A Record Host - @ The host name for the record, without the domain name. Points to - The IP address of hosting server TTL - Time to go live CNAME Records \u00b6 A CNAME record is a type of DNS record that\u2019s used to point a domain name to another domain name, instead of an IP address. CNAME Records are used for managing the subdomains of a website. The following image will show you how to add or edit a CNAME Record in the DNS Records. A typical CNAME Record has the following elements: Type of Record - CNAME Record Host - The name you want to keep for your subdomain Points to - The IP Address of hosting server of the subdomain TTL - Time to go live MX Records \u00b6 MX Record stands for Mail Exchanger Record .It is a type of DNS record that defines a mail server to handle email for a particular domain name. A MX Record directs email to a particular mail server. Like a CNAME, MX Entries must point to a domain and never point directly to an IP address. For example, email ID sharmapuneet@krenovate.com has been running on GSuite, the business version of Gmail. The following image will show you how to add or edit an MX Record in the DNS Records. A typical MX Record has the following elements: Type of Record - MX Record Host - @ (This means that you are running email services on your domain name) Points to - The hosting address of email provider (In this case the hosting provider is Google) Priority - Generally email providers will share multiple MX records with you, and a priority for each of them as well. TTL - Time to go live TXT Records \u00b6 The TXT Records are text records which are generally used for verifying ownership of a domain name. Many online service providers, in order to activate their services on your domain name, instruct you to add a custom and unique TXT Record. For example to activate Gsuite on our domain for emailing, we have to add the following TXT Record: A typical TXT Record has the following elements: Type of Record - TXT Record Host - @ (This means that you are pointing to your own domain name) TXT Value - The unique text record shared by some other organisation TTL - Time to go live Help & Guides \u00b6 For more information about DNS and it's features, refer to below links: DNS Tutorial DNS Records","title":"Domains Name System (DNS)"},{"location":"Domains-and-hosting/DNS/#domain-name-systems","text":"","title":"Domain Name Systems"},{"location":"Domains-and-hosting/DNS/#what-is-dns","text":"DNS stands for Domain Name System .

In simple terms, if your website was a house, then the domain name will be its address. In the same way that a GPS needs a street address or a zipcode to provide directions, a web browser needs a domain name to direct you to a website. Let's take a look at what goes on behind that domain: Every website is identified by a unique series of numbers called an IP address. This numeric set is what your computer uses to connect to the server where the website data lives. 4.87.97.110 - This is how an IP address looks like. Numbers are great for a computer, but it's easier for people to use words they can remember. The words used to identify a website are known as the domain and like the IP address, they're unique to each website. For example: Think of it like a mobile phone: you want to call your mother, so you simply click on your contact \"Mom\" and your phone dials your mother's phone number. Domains are connected to IP addresses in much the same way. Let's look at some examples for domain names: URL Domain Name https://www.wpbeginner.com wpbeginner https://www.hostinger.in hostinger https://www.lucidchart.com lucidchart Purpose of a Domain Name \u00b6 If you have a website, it needs to have an address, and that address needs to have a name. Other good reasons to register a Domain name are: Domain name gives a unique identity to your business. Once registered, no one else can take that name. So, you can register a domain by your personal name, company name or other things important to you. Having a registered domain also helps you get a personalised email address. Such email ids are easier to remember by customers. Having your own domain name, website and email addresses will give you and your business a more professional look. Having a registered domain name to protect copyrights and trademarks, build credibility, increase brand awareness, and search engine positioning. How does a Domain Name work? \u00b6 Domain names work because they provide computer users with a short name that is easy to remember. Users enter web addresses into the URL field at the top of their browser's page from left to right. The domain name itself is read from right to left according to the naming hierarchy discussed below. This link provides directions to the network, which ultimately results in a successful page load at the client end of the transaction. More info on Domains Domains Tutorial URL \u00b6 What is a URL \u00b6 A URL ( \u201cUniform Resource Locator\u201d ) is a complete web address used to reach a particular web destination. Many times people confuse domain name for URL and vice a versa. But, a domain name is part of a URL. You can see the visual difference in the following examples: A URL has four major parts which we will discuss in detail in the next section: 1. HTTP / HTTPS 2. TLD 3. Domain 4. Sub Domain HTTP/HTTPs \u00b6 What is HTTP? \u00b6 HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol HTTP is an application protocol that allows communication between different systems. Most commonly, it is used for transferring data from a web server to a browser to view web pages. Purpose of HTTP HTTP was invented alongside HTML to create the first interactive, text-based web browser: the original World Wide Web. Today, the protocol remains one of the primary means of using the Internet. Advantages of HTTP HTTP can be implemented with other protocol on the Internet, or on other networks HTTP pages are stored on computer and internet caches, so it is quickly accessible Platform independent which allows cross-platform porting Does not need any Runtime support Usable over Firewalls! Global applications are possible Not Connection Oriented; so no network overhead to create and maintain session state and information More about HTTP What is HTTPs? \u00b6 HTTPs stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. It is the secure version of HTTP, which is the primary protocol used to send data between a web browser and a website. HTTPS is encrypted in order to increase security of data transfer. This is particularly important when users transmit sensitive data, such as by logging into a bank account, email service, or health insurance provider. HTTPs uses an encryption protocol called SSL certificates to encrypt communications. **SSL Certificate** - SSL stands for Secure <br> Sockets Layer. SSL Certificate is a data file <br> issued by the authorised Certificate authority.<br> The SSL certificate contains the owner's public key and other details. The web server <br> sends a public key to the browser through an SSL certificate and the browser <br> verifies it and authenticates the web server using the SSL certificate. <br> Any https website will have a padlock Secure in the addressbar, as shown below. <br> Advantages of HTTPS In most cases, sites running over HTTPS will have a redirect in place. Therefore, even if you type in HTTP:// it will redirect to an https over a secured connection It allows users to perform secure e-commerce transaction, such as online banking. SSL technology protects any users and builds trust An independent authority verifies the identity of the certificate owner. So each SSL Certificate contains unique, authenticated information about the certificate owner. More about HTTPs HTTPs Tutorial HTTP vs HTTPs \u00b6 Below we will discuss the differences between HTTP and HTTPs and see which option is better: Parameter HTTP HTTPs Protocol It is hypertext transfer protocol. It is hypertext transfer protocol with secure. Security It is less secure as the data can be vulnerable to hackers. It is designed to prevent hackers from accessing critical information. It is secure against such attacks. Starts with URLs begin with http:// URLs begin with https:// Used for It's a good fit for websites designed for information consumption like blogs. If the website needs to collect the private information such as credit card number, then it is a more secure protocol Domain Name Validation HTTP website do not need SSL HTTPS requires SSL certificate Data encryption Doesn't use Encryption Uses encryption Search Ranking Does not improve ranking Helps to improve search rankings Speed Fast Slower than HTTP Vulnerability Vulnerable to hackers It Is highly secure as the data is encrypted before it is seen across a network Example TLD \u00b6 What is a TLD? \u00b6 TLD stands for Top Level Domain . It is the most important hierarchical part of a domain name. The TLD is the letters immediately following the final dot in an Internet address. A TLD identifies something about the website associated with it, such as its purpose, the organization that owns it or the geographical area where it originates. There are more than 1,000 TLDs available in the world. To make it clearer, let\u2019s break down an example domain name \u2013 www.example.com example : mid level domain .com : is the top level domain; it means its a commercial site. Types of TLDs \u00b6 Domain name aspects, especially TLDs, are coordinated by The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers or ICANN. ICANN classifies TLD into four main categories based on the website\u2019s purpose, owner, and geographical location, namely: Generic Top-level Domains: gTLD The gTLD is the most common domain that allows all range of users to register. The most familiar examples of this type of top-level domain are: .com \u2013 for commercial sites .org \u2013 for organizations .net \u2013 for networks .xyz \u2013 for general use .name \u2013 for individuals .biz \u2013 for businesses .info \u2013 for information platforms Sponsored Top-level Domains: sTLD The sTLD is a type of generic top-level domain that is handled by private organizations. Users who want to register their site under this domain should comply with certain rules. Some of the sTLD examples are: .gov \u2013 for U.S governmental sites .edu \u2013 for educational institutions .int \u2013 for treaty-related purpose international organizations .mil \u2013 for the U.S. military .mobi \u2013 for mobile product and service websites .jobs \u2013 for legal companies or organizations .tel \u2013 for internet communication service websites .post \u2013 for postal service sites .asia \u2013 for the Asia-Pacific region based websites Country Code Top-level Domains: ccTLD The country code TLD notes the location or territory ISO code. The ISO code is a two-letter code representing the name of certain areas. Common examples of this kind of TLD are: .es \u2013 Spain .ru \u2013 Russia .us \u2013 United States .ca \u2013 Canada .nl \u2013 Netherlands .de \u2013 Germany .fr \u2013 France .in \u2013 India .ch \u2013 Switzerland .jp \u2013 Japan .cn \u2013 China .br \u2013 Brazil .id \u2013 Indonesia Infrastructure Top-Level Domain The one and only infrastructure top-level domain available is ARPA. It stands for Address and Routing Parameter Area. It is reserved by IANA for IETF or Internet Engineering Task Force. Therefore, it is only used to solve technical infrastructure issues. Purpose of TLDs \u00b6 Since top-level domains are categorized based on what the website is associated with, it can be used to identify the website\u2019s purpose, owner, or geographical location \u2013 without even seeing the website\u2019s content. For example, the top-level domain .edu indicates that the website is used for educational purposes or owned by educational institutions. One thing that should be noted is that several websites could share the same name but different top-level domains.

You create subdomains to help organize and navigate to different sections of your main website. Within your main domain, you can have as many subdomains as necessary to get to all of the different pages of your website. For example: In the above image, we can see how Google has different subdomains to cater to the requirements of different users. Uses of Subdomains \u00b6 There are multiple uses of having subdomains. Few of them are discussed below: Most common use is to seperate a website into sections like blogs, support, e-commerce, forums etc. You can create different country versions of the website (in.godaddy.com) Another common use of a subdomain is creating a testing or staging version of a website. Advantages of sub domain \u00b6 Specific website for specific stakeholders. Easy to regulate and manage content and information for a specific set of users. Performance of one website does not affect the other, so if one of the subdomain crashes, the others won\u2019t get affected (if all our hosted on separate servers). Designing and planning a website becomes more easy and sensible. All subdomains can eventually run as individual entities. Good for organisations which deal with seperate kind of stakeholders. Please remember, creating subdomains for different products or services is not beneficial as subdomains are only helpful if we have multiple stakeholders. To be more clear, create subdomains only if you have different stakeholders like customers, vendors, suppliers, employees and prospective customers and that too if it cannot be handled on a single website.

In simple terms, if your website was a house, then the domain name will be its address. In the same way that a GPS needs a street address or a zipcode to provide directions, a web browser needs a domain name to direct you to a website. Let's take a look at what goes on behind that domain: Every website is identified by a unique series of numbers called an IP address. This numeric set is what your computer uses to connect to the server where the website data lives. 4.87.97.110 - This is how an IP address looks like. Numbers are great for a computer, but it's easier for people to use words they can remember. The words used to identify a website are known as the domain and like the IP address, they're unique to each website. For example: Think of it like a mobile phone: you want to call your mother, so you simply click on your contact \"Mom\" and your phone dials your mother's phone number. Domains are connected to IP addresses in much the same way.

How Web Hosting works \u00b6 When you sign up for a web hosting service, you basically rent some space on a physical server where you can store all the files and data necessary for your website to work properly. Servers \u00b6 A server is a physical computer that runs without any interruption so that your website is available all the time for anyone who wants to see it. Your web host is responsible for keeping that server up and running, protecting it from malicious attacks, and transferring your content \u2014 such as text, images, files, etc. \u2014 from the server to your visitors\u2019 browsers. A server is a computer that connects other web users to your site from anywhere in the world. As the name implies, web hosting service providers have the servers, connectivity, and associated services to host websites. By offering a variety of hosting plans, they cover the spectrum of hosting needs, from small blogs and large organizations. Simply put, all machines that store data and serve it on request are servers. For eg: laptop, USB, phones etc. Types of Servers \u00b6 Servers can be online and offline. Offline servers are your laptop, USB, mobile phones and anything that shows you data without using the internet . Online servers are similar machines which store information and data and are only accessible through the internet . Online servers are provided by hosting providers, companies which are in the business of creating and managing online servers. For example, Godaddy is a hosting provider that offers a range of different types of online servers that you can use to store and run your websites and apps. All online servers have an IP address, which is used to access the information on that server. Types of Hosting \u00b6 Most web hosts offer different types of hosting so that they can serve the needs of different clients \u2014 whether you want to build a simple personal blog or own a large online business and are in a dire need of an intricate company website. Here are the most popular options available: Shared hosting VPS hosting Cloud hosting WordPress hosting Dedicated hosting For the sake of understanding, we will discuss the two most important options, namely, Shared Hosting and Cloud Hosting. Shared Hosting \u00b6 With this type of hosting, your site shares a physical server with one or more other websites. Shared hosting allows multiple websites to utilize a single server. Usually, you\u2019ll have no idea who or what websites you\u2019re sharing the resources of a server with. Cloud Hosting \u00b6 Cloud hosting is a type of web hosting which uses multiple different servers to balance the load and maximize uptime. Instead of using a single server, your website can tap into a \u201ccluster\u201d that uses resources from a centralized pool. Visualise the cloud as a web of different computers which are all interconnected. As more machines are hooked up to the network, more resources are added to the overall cloud. Difference between Shared Hosting and Cloud Hosting \u00b6 In this section we will discuss the main difference between Shared and Cloud Hosting: Shared Hosting Cloud Hosting 1. Multiple websites are hosted on a single server. 1. Dedicated individual server for each website. 2. All websites have a common IP address. 2. Each website has an exclusive IP address. 3. If the server crashes, all websites go down together. 3. If the server crashes, only the website hosted on it crashes, does not affect other websites. 4. If you buy shared hosting, you get server space in a server that is also being used for other websites. 4. If you buy cloud hosting, you get server space in a dedicated server that is exclusively being used for only your website. 5. You cannot make any technical changes to the server as it is shared. 5. You can make whatever technical changes you want to perform in your cloud server. 6. Good for simple business websites. 6. Good for e-commerce and product based websites. 7. Prices are generally affordable and cheap. 7. Prices are dynamic based on server usage, they go up with the no. of users on your website.

Design is how it works.\" -Steve Jobs What is Web Designing \u00b6 A web design can have various definitions: Web design is the process of planning, conceptualizing, and arranging content intended for the Internet. It refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than software development. Web design is what creates the overall look and feel when you\u2019re using a website. It\u2019s the process of planning and building the elements of your website, from structure and layout to images, colors, fonts and graphics. Modern web design goes beyond how things look (aesthetics) to include how things work (functionality) . Web design is not limited to websites as it includes other uses such as web apps, mobile apps, and user interface design. Why is Web Design Important \u00b6 If only given 15 minutes to consume content, 66 percent of people would prefer to see something beautifully designed versus something plain and simple. There is no arguement about the fact that First impressions really matter. Your website\u2019s design is an important part of your online marketing presence. To build a better website for your business, you must understand the importance of web design. So, let's look at the reasons why Web Design is important: It sets the first impression : The first impression impacts how your audience will perceive your brand. A good design will help keep leads glued to your page. It aids the SEO strategy : Many web design elements and practices influence how you publish content on your website, which in turn affects how search engine spiders crawl and index your website. This is one thing you cannot afford to mess up. It sets the impression for customer service : Think of your web design as the digital face of your business. If someone walked into your physical location, wouldn\u2019t you want a friendly face to greet them and make them feel welcome? An updated and modern web design is the equivalent to a friendly face greeting your new visitors. Your design gives them insight as to how you view your audience and the efforts you are ready to put in to make them satisfied. It builds trust with your audience : It\u2019s important to build trust with your audience so they remain on your site. When visitors remain on your site longer, you create more opportunities for your business to capture those leads. A professional site signals trust with your audience. Your competitors are doing it : A well-designed website is an opportunity for your business to showcase your unique features. You can show your audience why they should choose your business over the competition. It creates consistency : Consistency helps your audience build brand recognition and keeps them engaged on your page for longer. You need to have the same fonts, styles, and layouts across every page on your website otherwise your site will look unprofessional. Features of a effective Web Design \u00b6 A good/effective web design is easy to use, aesthetically pleasing, and suits the user group and brand of the website. In order to acheive a quality design, we have to keep in mind the most important elements of web design. When designing a website, it\u2019s imperative to consider both the look (Visual Elements) and the functionality (Functional Elements) of the site. Integrating these elements into the design will help maximize the performance of the site, regardless of how performance is measured. Let's look at what these elements are: Visual Elements \u00b6 Here\u2019s a quick overview of the elements you need to consider in your design to make sure everything looks good! Written Copy : Fundamentally, the look of a website and its words go hand in hand. The two should never really be considered separate. Having your designers and content writers work together, can be a more powerful combination. Fonts : It's imperative to easy-to-read font pairings that complement the design. Colors : Colors are one of the most important elements to consider when designing a website. When choosing colors for your site, it\u2019s important to focus on aligning your colors with your brand and the message you are trying to convey. Layout : How you decide to arrange your content will have a dramatic impact on both the appearance and functionality of your site. Shapes : Graphical elements have taken an important place in web design. Combining beautiful colors and shapes can be used to accomplish many things, such as directing the attention of your site visitors. Spacing : There is a space that exists between every element within your design: the images, the paragraphs, the lines... even the letters have spacing! As a rule of thumb, having too much space is better than having things crammed together. Images & Icons : Amazing designs can communicate a lot of information in just a few seconds. One of the ways to accomplish this is through the use of powerful images and icons. Videos : When used properly, they can help your website visitors experience something that simply can\u2019t be described with words or images. One thing to keep in mind is that eye-catching videos can be distracting and should never compete with your content. Funtional Elements \u00b6 The functional elements decide the working of any website. Let's look at the elements involved: Navigation : Navigation is one of the main components that determines if your website actually \u201cworks\u201d. The navigation should serve multiple purposes, like, catering to the needs of a new user and a returning user. There are a few best practices you will want to follow. Speed : No one likes slow websites. Regardless of how nice your design is, if it doesn\u2019t load within a reasonable time, it will not perform in search, and it will not accomplish your goals. Choose tools which provide optimum performance. Animations : Effective web animation techniques can help your design accomplish a wide range of tasks, from grabbing a user\u2019s attention to giving feedback on certain interactions with content like buttons or forms. User Interactions : The best designs should always simply the visitor interactions (scrolling, clicking, typing) giving the user the impression that they are in complete control. Site Structure : A website\u2019s structure plays an important role in both user experience and SEO. If people are getting lost navigating through your site, chances are, crawlers will too. Some tips to create effective site structure are available here Cross-browser & cross-device compatibility : A great design is the one that will look good on all devices and browsers (including Internet Explorer). Types of website design \u00b6 Although you might come across articles online that talk about a whole bunch of website design styles (fixed, static, fluid, etc), but there are only two ways to properly design a website: adaptive and responsive websites. Adaptive Websites \u00b6 Adaptive web design uses two or more versions of a website that are customized for different screen sizes. Adaptive websites can be split in two main categories based upon how the site detects what \u201cversion\u201d needs to be displayed. Basically, this means the site knows what version to display (ex: desktop or mobile). Responsive Websites \u00b6 Responsive websites use a combination of flexible grids (based on percentages) with breakpoints (using media queries) to create a custom look at every screen size. Unlike adaptive sites that adapt only when they hit a breakpoint, responsive websites are constantly changing according to the screen size. Designing Process \u00b6 The designing process of a great website consists of two parts: UX - User Experience UI - User Interface Help & Guides \u00b6 Web Design Guide Guide for importance of Web Design","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Website-Designing/Introduction/#website-designing","text":"\"Design is not just what it looks like and feels like.

It is about enhancing the experience that people have while interacting with your product, and making sure they find value in what you are providing. Some industry experts have their own definitions of UX discussed as below: It is the process used to determine what the experience will be like when a user interacts with your product. It is an approach to design that takes the user into account. It is about solving problems through empathy. It is a process for designing systems that offer a great experience to users. It is improving how useful, easy, pleasant, marketable, or addictive it is to use a product. It is the fulfillment of a brand\u2019s promise. It is the art and science of generating positive emotions through product interactions. It is a commitment to building products with the customer in mind. It is the creative and analytical process of determining what a website, device, or piece of software is going to be. It is so much more than just designing for a screen. It is design with an awareness of every touchpoint that makes up the overall experience with your product or service. It is a process of deeply understanding the user's needs and objectives. It is a commitment to developing products and services with purpose, compassion, and integrity. It\u2019s the practice of meeting people\u2019s needs before, during, and after product development. It is about delighting users by anticipating their needs and giving them something they didn\u2019t think to ask for. In all the above definitions, we can see that a UX Design is completely user-centric. It's all about delighting the user. There are seven factors that influence the user experience: The key ingredients for a great user experience on a website include the following: More on What is UX Design UX Design Tutorial The Design Process \u00b6 The design process involves: researching and studying user behaviour understanding the content map created for the different user lifcycle stages . The output of this stage is a wireframe , which depicts the exact places and points for everything that needs to be presented on the website. Wireframe \u00b6 A wireframe is a simple black and white blueprint/layout that focuses purely on a site's structural elements. They are devoid of color, font choices, logos or any real design elements that take away from purely focusing on a site\u2019s structure. A wireframe is commonly used to lay out content and functionality on a page which takes into account user needs and user journeys. A wireframe is: A grayscale blueprint of your site\u2019s key conversion pages A view into how your site, and each page, might tell your story A chance to explore features, elements, calls-to-action, and site navigation A first glance at header copy, scannable sections, and more in-depth sections A chance to understand how each page lends itself towards conversion as part of a complete UX An opportunity to make changes to structure, architecture, and identify what\u2019s missing Here are a few examples of how a wireframe looks like: Read more about Wireframing Advantages of Wireframing \u00b6 The most important advantges of going through the process of Wireframing are as below: It provides an early visual that can be used to review with the client. Users can also review it as an early feedback mechanism for prototype usability tests. As wireframes are easier to amend compared to concept designs, once they are approved by the client/users, they provide confidence to the designer to move ahead with the design. A wireframe provides confidence to the clients as they get know how their final product may look like. From a practical perspective, the wireframes ensure the page content and functionality are positioned correctly based on user and business needs. And as the project moves forward they can be used as a good dialogue between members of the project team to agree on the project vision and scope. Reasons for Wireframing Types of Wireframes \u00b6 Typically, at Krenovate we use two types of wireframes. Let's have a look of these: Low-fidelity Wireframes \u00b6 Low-fidelity wireframes are basic visual representations of the webpage and usually serve as the design\u2019s starting point. They are typically concept sketches, a set of drawings or storyboard, representing the skeleton of the interface. Low fidelity wireframes include the most basic content and visuals and are usually static (not interactive). They are often used to help map out the shell of the interface, its screens and basic information architecture. Below is an image of a simple low-fidelity wireframe: High-fidelity Wireframes \u00b6 High fidelity wireframes or prototypes are more complete representations of the end product. Many are clickable and respond to the user\u2019s actions, mimicking authentic interface interaction. Their aesthetics and content are more precise than lower down the fidelity spectrum, as designers concentrate on refining the graphics, spacing and layout. These wireframes provide test participants with realistic representations of what the product will look and feel like, as well as how it will respond to them. A typical high-fidelity wireframe looks like: Wireframe Tools \u00b6 The process of wireframing/prototyping is made easy by using the below tools: Adobe Xd Figma Sketch Some UX facts to be remembered: \u00b6 UX planning should be done thoroughly and should be aligned with the content maps created for the website. Do not skip this step. Business owners/clients should be closely involved in finalising and reviewing these wireframes as this reduces a lot of iteration work on the further stages of UI and development. The more time and effort you put on this stage, the more quickly the final website can be delivered. Sometimes UX planning is left to the graphic designer, that is a blunder you can do for your website. Graphic designers are not UX experts . UX experts are people who study online user behavior based on content maps and industry research to create working prototypes.","title":"UX"},{"location":"Website-Designing/UX/#user-experience-ux","text":"\u201cUser experience encompasses all aspects of the end-user\u2019s interaction with the company, its services, and its products.\u201d ~ Don Norman ~","title":"User Experience (UX)"},{"location":"Website-Designing/UX/#what-is-ux-design","text":"UX Design is the process of designing products that are useful, easy to use, and delightful to interact with. It is about enhancing the experience that people have while interacting with your product, and making sure they find value in what you are providing. Some industry experts have their own definitions of UX discussed as below: It is the process used to determine what the experience will be like when a user interacts with your product. It is an approach to design that takes the user into account. It is about solving problems through empathy. It is a process for designing systems that offer a great experience to users. It is improving how useful, easy, pleasant, marketable, or addictive it is to use a product. It is the fulfillment of a brand\u2019s promise. It is the art and science of generating positive emotions through product interactions. It is a commitment to building products with the customer in mind. It is the creative and analytical process of determining what a website, device, or piece of software is going to be. It is so much more than just designing for a screen. It is design with an awareness of every touchpoint that makes up the overall experience with your product or service. It is a process of deeply understanding the user's needs and objectives. It is a commitment to developing products and services with purpose, compassion, and integrity. It\u2019s the practice of meeting people\u2019s needs before, during, and after product development. It is about delighting users by anticipating their needs and giving them something they didn\u2019t think to ask for. In all the above definitions, we can see that a UX Design is completely user-centric. It's all about delighting the user. There are seven factors that influence the user experience: The key ingredients for a great user experience on a website include the following: More on What is UX Design UX Design Tutorial","title":"What is UX Design?"},{"location":"Website-Designing/UX/#the-design-process","text":"The design process involves: researching and studying user behaviour understanding the content map created for the different user lifcycle stages .

They are devoid of color, font choices, logos or any real design elements that take away from purely focusing on a site\u2019s structure. A wireframe is commonly used to lay out content and functionality on a page which takes into account user needs and user journeys. A wireframe is: A grayscale blueprint of your site\u2019s key conversion pages A view into how your site, and each page, might tell your story A chance to explore features, elements, calls-to-action, and site navigation A first glance at header copy, scannable sections, and more in-depth sections A chance to understand how each page lends itself towards conversion as part of a complete UX An opportunity to make changes to structure, architecture, and identify what\u2019s missing Here are a few examples of how a wireframe looks like: Read more about Wireframing","title":"Wireframe"},{"location":"Website-Designing/UX/#advantages-of-wireframing","text":"The most important advantges of going through the process of Wireframing are as below: It provides an early visual that can be used to review with the client. Users can also review it as an early feedback mechanism for prototype usability tests. As wireframes are easier to amend compared to concept designs, once they are approved by the client/users, they provide confidence to the designer to move ahead with the design. A wireframe provides confidence to the clients as they get know how their final product may look like. From a practical perspective, the wireframes ensure the page content and functionality are positioned correctly based on user and business needs. And as the project moves forward they can be used as a good dialogue between members of the project team to agree on the project vision and scope.
