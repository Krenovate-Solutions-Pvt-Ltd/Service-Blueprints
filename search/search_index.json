All websites run on different servers. Your domain name is linked and attached to a particular server through the DNS. Every server has a public IP address by which it is identified. For example the server IP address for Krenovate.com is 64.90.44.34. It is difficult to remember an IP Address, and that is why it becomes necessary to attach this IP address to the domain name of your organisation. Humans are inclined to remember names rather than numbers. DNS system allows you to manage multiple things through the different set of records available in the DNS system. We will discuss the most important records in the DNS, which are as follows: 1. Nameservers 2. A records 3. CNAME Records 4. MX Records 5. TXT Records You can access the DNS records of your domain by logging into your domain management account. I generally use Godaddy to buy domains, the below image is a snapshot of the account I have at Godaddy to manage the domains I own. It has various domains bought by my organisation. If you look closely, in front of every domain name you will find a prominent button with the CTA \u2018DNS\u2019. By clicking this you will reach the DNS records of the respective domain name. 1. Nameservers \u00b6 Nameservers help you identify the hosting service for the particular domain name. For example, if i have to host my domain on Dreamhost which is a web hosting service, I have to point my domain to Dreamhost using the Dreamhost nameservers. Each domain is pointed to a minimum of two nameservers. Nameservers are always managed from the domain management account. Look at the following image, which is a snapshot of the nameservers of Krenovate.com. As you can see in the above image nameservers of Krenovate.com point to Dreamhost, making it clear that www.krenovate.com is hosted on Dreamhost. Nameservers are generally written in the format \u2018ns1.servername.com\u2019. Also the particular nameservers help you identify the place from where you can manage the DNS records. DNS records are always available and can be modified from the hosting service provider of your website. If I have to make any changes to the DNS records of Krenovate.com, I will have to do the same in my Dreamhost Hosting Account. To help you understand better, let me give you possible two scenarios. Scenario 1 - Domain Provider and Hosting Provider are the same.This simply means that you bought a domain on Godaddy and have also bought hosting services from Godaddy itself. Scenario 2 - Domain Provider and Hosting Provider are different This is the scenario of Krenovate.com, the domain name Krenovate.com has been bought and managed on Godaddy , while the website Krenovate.com is hosted on Dreamhost . The following table will help you understand where you will manage your DNS records and nameservers in the aforementioned scenarios. Domain Management Scenario 1 Scenario 2 Nameservers The nameservers are always managed through domain provider account. Godaddy Godaddy DNS Records The DNS records are always managed through hosting provider account. Goddady Dreamhost Scenario 1 \u00b6 The following image will show you that you can see and manage both nameservers and DNS records from your Godaddy account. Scenario 2 \u00b6 The following image will show you that you can only see and manage nameservers from your Godaddy account and it says DNS records cannot be displayed as nameservers are pointed to Dreamhost. 2. A Records \u00b6 The A Record is the most important record as it connects your domain name to the relevant IP address of your hosting server. The following image will show you how to add or edit an A Record in your DNS Records. A Record has the following elements: Type of Record - A Record Host - @ The host name for the record, without the domain name. Points to - The IP address of hosting server TTL - Time to go live 3. CNAME Records \u00b6 CNAME Records are used for managing the subdomains of a website. The following image will show you how to add or edit a CNAME Record in your DNS Records. A typical CNAME Record has the following elements: Type of Record - CNAME Record Host - The name you want to keep for your subdomain Points to - The IP Address of your hosting server of the subdomain TTL - Time to go live 4. MX Records \u00b6 MX Records are used for managing the email services of a domain. For example, email ID sharmapuneet@krenovate.com has been running on GSuite, the business version of Gmail. The following image will show you how to add or edit an MX Record in your DNS Records. A typical MX Record has the following elements: Type of Record - MX Record Host - @ (This means that you are running email services on your domain name) Points to - The hosting address of email provider (In this case the hosting provider is Google) Priority - Generally email providers will share multiple MX records with you, and a priority for each of them as well. TTL - Time to go live 4. TXT Records \u00b6 The TXT Records are text records and generally used for verifying ownership of a domain name. Many online service providers to activate their services on your domain name, instruct you to add a custom and unique TXT Record. For example to activate Gsuite on my domain for emailing, I had to add the following TXT Record. A typical TXT Record has the following elements: Type of Record - TXT Record Host - @ (This means that you are pointing to your own domain name) TXT Value - The unique text record shared by some other organisation TTL - Time to go live","title":"Domains Name System (DNS)"},{"location":"Domains-and-hosting/DNS/#domain-name-systems","text":"DNS is the control panel for the domain names you buy on websites like Godaddy.

A domain name is the address where internet users can access your website. A domain name is used for finding and identifying computers on the Internet. Computers use IP addresses, which are a series of number. However, it is difficult for humans to remember strings of numbers. Because of this, domain names were developed and used to identify entities on the Internet rather than using IP addresses. A domain name can be any combination of letters and numbers, and it can be used in combination of the various domain name extensions, such as .com, .net and more. The domain name must be registered before you can use it. Every domain name is unique. No two websites can have the same domain name. For example if someone types in krenovate.com, it will go to Krenovate's website and no one else's. URL \u00b6 A URL ( \u201cUniform Resource Locator\u201d ) is a complete web address used to reach a particular web destination. A URL has four major parts: 1. HTTPS / HTTP 2. TLD 3. Domain 4. Sub Domain 1. HTTPS/HTTP \u00b6 You should capture email IDs using simple sign up forms for newsletter of your company for all the people visiting your website. People who will be interested in your products or services will sign up, as they might be interested to get regular updates about your business. The internet has over 1.5 billion websites, the information and data on each website is fetched and presented to you by the HTTP ( Hyper transfer text protocol ) technology that is as old as the internet. The HTTPS ( Hyper transfer text protocol secure ) is a more secure way of fetching & presenting data and information on websites. The data and information on HTTPS websites is encrypted using SSL certificates . These certificates convert any data or information in an encrypted format, so that even if someone gets access to some confidential information data from the website it is an encrypted format and no one can perform any scam or fraud online by using such information. To give you a simple example, when you buy anything online by entering your credit card details, e-commerce websites use SSL certificates to convert the data you have entered to be saved in an encrypted format, so that no one can use your credit card details to do some fraud online shopping or scammy online purchases. Let\u2019s say you entered your credit card number as 1234 5678 9999 0000 , all HTTPS websites will convert this data into an encrypted format like \u2018kjbdy87343hkdh873837864hdwsdtrsdwte72328627362876826vsjhdwud67e228736287632\u2019 And this encryption changes every time you enter any data on any HTTPS website. HTTP vs HTTPS \u00b6 HTTP ( No encryption ) \u00b6 Data entered: 1234 5678 9999 0000 Data saved as: 1234 5678 9999 0000 HTTPS ( Encryption through SSL certificates ) \u00b6 Data entered: 1234 5678 9999 0000 Data saved as: nhnkqoayhgqlabgjmcieioegebsksbshs8782n9dybsjsi8eyey920jsn Needless to say that you should avoid sharing any confidential data on a HTTP website. Also Google Chrome to safeguard and make people aware about non secure websites using HTTP only has started writing \u2018unsecure\u2019 just before their URL. Look at the image. While websites using SSL certificate are marked as safe by Google Chrome, look at the following image. 2. TLD \u00b6 Also known as the top-level domain . The most common used TLD is \u2018.com\u2019. TLDs are generally used as a reference to a geographic area or a type of community, group, organisation. For example, \u2018.com.au\u2019 will reflect that the website is run by an Australian organisation, similarly \u2018.edu\u2019 is a TLD generally used by colleges, schools and educational institutes. There are more than 1,000 TLDs available in the world. The following are the top 10 used TLDs in the world: 1) .COM: 82.01 million \u00b6 2) .DE (Germany): 13.05 million \u00b6 3) .CN (China): 12.55 million \u00b6 4) .NET: 12.42 million \u00b6 5) .UK (United Kingdom): 7.83 million \u00b6 6) .ORG: 7.79 million \u00b6 7) .INFO: 5.24 million \u00b6 8) .NL (Netherlands): 3.5 million \u00b6 9) .EU (European Union): 2.98 million \u00b6 10) .RU (Russia): 2.31 million \u00b6 So if you are launching a website for a business in Europe it makes more sense to launch it under the .EU TLD , because people in europe would be more accustomed to open websites with .EU TLD . Also there are some TLDs available which directly represent a business category, like the .AGENCY TLD , so if you are planning to open up an agency for any industry, it makes more sense to buy a domain name under the .AGENCY TLD . TLD's used in world Top 10 used TLDs in the world 3. Domain \u00b6 Kickstarting any business online with a website starts with a booking a domain name. Once you have shortlisted the right TLDs based on your business/organisation category the next step is to search and book the domain name for your online business. You should follow the following guidelines to book a domain name for your business. Shortlist relevant TLDs Prefer a single word for your domain name For example the official name of my organisation is \u2018 Krenovate Solutions Pvt Ltd \u2019 but the website runs under the brand name \u2018 Krenovate.com \u2019 \u2018Godaddy\u2019 does not have all TLDs available, book domains on United Domains Book your domain name for extra TLDs (like .co, .co.in, .xyz, .work etc.), which are not very expensive, this will be helpful for bulk email marketing. 3. Sub Domains \u00b6 Apple has a very beautiful website, that anyone can visit by typing in the given Apple link for buying and finding information for all Apple products. On the other hand, customers of Apple, if they want any help or support for their old purchases have to visit Apple customer support link . Both websites ( https://www.apple.com/ ) which is referred to as Apple link here and( https://support.apple.com/)which is referred to as Apple customer support link in this section run on the same domain name i.e. apple.com. These are actually two different websites for different set of users. Visitors of Apple.com and support.apple.com are absolutely different.Prospect or any person who wants to find out any information about Apple visits the main website Apple link , while registered customers of Apple visit Apple customer support link which is a subdomain of Apple.com for help and support on products and services. Any person/organisation who has bought a domain name can create an unlimited number of subdomains without any extra cost. Subdomains help organisations to manage a similar set of users access relevant information on a separate independent website. Subdomains have the following advantages: 1. Specific website for specific stakeholders. \u00b6 2. Easy to regulate and manage content and information for a specific set of users. \u00b6 3. Performance of one website does not affect the other, so if one of the subdomain crashes, the others won\u2019t get affected (if all our hosted on separate servers). \u00b6 4. Designing and planning a website becomes more easy and sensible. \u00b6 5. All subdomains can eventually run as individual entities. \u00b6 6. Good for organisations which deal with seperate kind of stakeholders. \u00b6 Please remember, creating subdomains for different products or services is not beneficial as subdomains are only helpful if you have multiple stakeholders. To be more clear, create subdomains only if you have different stakeholders like customers, vendors, suppliers, employees and prospective customers and that too if you cannot handle them on a single website.","title":"Domains"},{"location":"Domains-and-hosting/Domains/#domain","text":"","title":"Domain"},{"location":"Domains-and-hosting/Domains/#domain-name","text":"A domain name is your website name.
