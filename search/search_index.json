Building content maps is the first step towards making a good website. It acts as a blueprint of your website. It allows you and your team to be organized and visualize what the site will become. It is a valuable tool when you are working with a web design company to produce your website. What is Content Mapping? \u00b6 Content Mapping focuses on how each piece of the content is strategically related to and supports the customer/client journey. It helps us to relate and connect to each of the phases/steps in a customer journey and helps us to deliver better and meet the needs of our target audience. Content mapping takes into account the characteristics of the person who will be consuming the content and their lifecycle stage. Three Pillars \u00b6 To create an effective website you need to keep in mind these three pillars of content mapping which are as follows: Right Content \u00b6 This means creating valuable content for the users/customers/clients visiting your website. For example if you have build a website for fashion and clothing you have to put the content for the same and not for health and fitness because if users are visiting a website for fashion and clothing they should be shown content relevant to fashion and clothing and not health and fitness.That will make more sense to them. Right People \u00b6 People who visit your website will be generally from differet age groups, interests and needs. By 'right people' it means if you have build a website for women clothing and showing content for men fashion trends and sales on men wear it will not generate good sales for women clothing as your content is not specific for the people you have defined. Right Time \u00b6 By right time we do not mean that your website should have different content on different dates and time. By this we meant that a user/client goes through different stages before coming to a decision. For example Mr. A has to buy a shirt and he is gathering the information for the same from different websites. So he is in the process of getting details but he visits a website whhich is showing him there is a 30% discount for the same. At that particular 'gathering the information' stage he is getting the irrelevant content which he may require later. So it becomes very important for organisations to create the content based on the lifecycle stage of the person visiting the website. Benefits of Content Mapping \u00b6 It helps you understand your customer and lays out their journey. It gives you an overview of all the content you have and identify the holes in your content strategy. It helps you get the most out of your content. It can double as a Keyword map. It aligns content with personas. It helps customers through their purchase funnel. Content Mapping activity \u00b6 A Content Mapping Activity is divided into two sections as follows: 1. User/Buyer persona 2. Lifecycle Stages User Persona \u00b6 Personas and content mapping go hand in hand. You can't create a useful, accurate content map without developing an in-depth user/buyer persona first. What it is? \u00b6 A user persona is a detailed description of your ideal audience. It helps you get to know your customers and understand what they know, want, and need. It help businesses understand and empathize with their customers so they can do a better job of acquiring and serving them. A persona is about perception. For example in the business world, for instance if a businessman wants others to think that he is very powerful and successful, he might drive a fancy car, buy a big house, wear expensive clothing, and talk down to people that he thinks are below him on the social ladder. Sources to gain information \u00b6 While strategisisng you need to know what is currently trending in your area, what people are more curious about, which keyword will work best at that particular time.

It leverages data and innovation to reach millions globally. So you can gather information about the trending topics and get aware and create a content map based on that.

It outlines five stages of the customer journey: 1. Awareness Phase: In this phase, a prospect becomes aware of a need. They begin seeking fulfilment of that need, a solution to a problem, or an answer to a question. During their search, they start to notice a brand for the first time. They become aware of the company, gain a broad understanding of who they are and what they offer, and start to see how the brand could help them. 2. Engagement Phase: In this phase, a customer is already familiar with a brand and they are learning more about them. The brand and the prospect have formed some sort of connection as the prospect gathers information that helps them in some way. The prospect may have followed the brand on social media, opted in for a newsletter, or signed up for a free trial or content upgrade. 3. Evaluation Phase: By this phase, the prospect already knows that the brand can solve their problem or provide what they need but they are still considering if the brand is the best available solution. They do research and compare the brand to others in the market. 4. Purchase Phase: During this phase, the prospect turns into a paying customer. They have decided on a brand and are ready to buy. They just need the tools, process, and path to make their purchase. 5. Post-purchase Phase: The customer journey does not end once the prospect makes a purchase. Customers at this point may need additional support or services, and they are also primed to buy again.

Create a buyer persona to understand your audience. \u00b6 A buyer/user persona typically outlines the following characteristics of the ideal buyer: Demographics: It includes age, gender, income, location, family situation, income, education, etc. Professional Role: It mainly focuses on Industry, job title, company size Values and Goals: What the user believe strongly in, professional and personal goals, values, lifestyle details Challenges: What challenges the user is facing, pain points, fears, issues at work or home Sources and Influences: What are their favorite blogs, books, thought leaders, conferences Buying Habits: What objections they keep before buying, where from they buy, how long it takes them to buy, who makes the buying decisions. Check out the image given below: Step 2. Document the journey your customer takes on their way to doing business with you. \u00b6 Once you have a clarity of who your ideal customer is, the content mapping process will be easier. You can use what you know about your ideal buyer to create a customer journey map that illustrates the path that person takes on their way to doing business with you. The journey map outlines your brand\u2019s unique purchase funnel and how your ideal customer moves through it. It outlines five stages of the marketing funnel: Awareness Engagement Evaluation Purchase Post-purchase It also focuses on customer experiences at each stage of the marketing funnel. It may document the details for each phase. Customer Actions: What the customer is doing like performing a Google search, visiting a website etc. Customer Questions and Thoughts: What the customer is thinking about price, competitors, the offering\u2019s ability to solve problems, etc. Branded Touch Points: The branded customer platforms or interactions the customer experiences visiting your website, visiting a physical store location, speaking with customer services reps, etc. Brand Opportunities: What your brand can offer to customers to help and support them based on their actions, questions, thoughts, and the touch points they experience in that phase of the marketing funnel. After laying out the customer journey it\u2019s more clear what content you should create to attract, nurture, and guide customers during their journey. Step 3. Understand what content works best in each phase of the customer journey. \u00b6 Awareness content or top-of-funnel content attracts new audiences to your brand and helps prospects find answers to the questions they ask when they have a requirement. Engagement content keeps audiences interested in your brand so that when they are ready to buy, they choose your company. Evaluation content or middle-of-funnel marketing content helps inform customers as they decide if your brand, products, and services are a fit for what they require. Purchase content or bottom-of-funnel content is what customers interact with when they are ready to buy. It targets buyer keywords and helps customers feel confident in making their purchase. Post-purchase content supports customers after their purchase and also re-engages and remarkets to them to bring them back into the purchase funnel. Step 4. Create a catalog of the content you have. \u00b6 Perform a content audit and create a catalog of all the content you have which will prevent you from creating duplicate or redundant content assets. List each piece of content and relevant details as given in the image below: Refer the below link to get more info about creating catalog: https://blog.alexa.com/use-content-audit-template-assess-measure-plan-future/ Step 5. Map existing content to relevant phases of the customer journey. \u00b6 The things you should consider while filling your content map: The type of content As mentioned earlier, certain types of content work better in certain phases of the customer journey. Look at the type of content and decide where it best aligns with the phases of your content map. The content\u2019s conversion point As you consider where the content belongs in the map, also look at what the content tells the audience to do next. Make sure the call to action at the end of the content guides the customer to the next phase of the buyer\u2019s journey. The quality of the content Not all of your existing content may belong in your content map. If you find that the quality of an existing piece of content is low, don\u2019t use it in your content mapping. Leave it out and make a note that it could be revised later. Step 6. Create targeted content for gaps in your content map. \u00b6 Identify parts of your funnel that have inadequate/shallow content and create a plan for filling those gaps. You can gp back to your catalog of existing content and look for ways to repurpose what you have and use it in other phases of the funnel.","title":"Strategic Content Map"},{"location":"Content-Mapping/Strategic-content-map/#how-to-create-a-strategic-content-map","text":"","title":"How to create a Strategic Content Map"},{"location":"Content-Mapping/Strategic-content-map/#step-1-create-a-buyer-persona-to-understand-your-audience","text":"A buyer/user persona typically outlines the following characteristics of the ideal buyer: Demographics: It includes age, gender, income, location, family situation, income, education, etc. Professional Role: It mainly focuses on Industry, job title, company size Values and Goals: What the user believe strongly in, professional and personal goals, values, lifestyle details Challenges: What challenges the user is facing, pain points, fears, issues at work or home Sources and Influences: What are their favorite blogs, books, thought leaders, conferences Buying Habits: What objections they keep before buying, where from they buy, how long it takes them to buy, who makes the buying decisions.

All websites run on different servers.The domain name is linked and attached to a particular server through the DNS.The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources. Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device. How DNS works \u00b6 The domain name system maps the name we use to locate a website to the IP address that a computer uses to locate a website. Every server has a public IP address by which it is identified. For example the server IP address for Krenovate.com is 64.90.44.34. It is difficult to remember an IP Address, and that is why it becomes necessary to attach this IP address to the domain name of the organisation. Humans are inclined to remember names rather than numbers. DNS system allows us to manage multiple things through the different set of records available in the DNS system. We will discuss the most important records in the DNS, which are as follows: 1. Nameservers 2. A records 3. CNAME Records 4. MX Records 5. TXT Records We can access the DNS records of our domain by logging into our domain management account. We generally use Godaddy to buy domains, the below image is a snapshot of the account we have at Godaddy to manage the domains we own. It has various domains bought by our organisation. If we look closely, in front of every domain name we will find a prominent button with the CTA \u2018DNS\u2019. By clicking this we will reach the DNS records of the respective domain name. 1. Nameservers \u00b6 Nameservers help us identify the hosting service for the particular domain name. For example, if we have to host a domain on Dreamhost which is a web hosting service, we have to point the domain to Dreamhost using the Dreamhost nameservers. Each domain is pointed to a minimum of two nameservers. Nameservers are always managed from the domain management account. Look at the following image, which is a snapshot of the nameservers of Krenovate.com. As we can see in the above image nameservers of Krenovate.com point to Dreamhost, making it clear that www.krenovate.com is hosted on Dreamhost. Nameservers are generally written in the format \u2018ns1.servername.com\u2019. Also the particular nameservers help us identify the place from where we can manage the DNS records. DNS records are always available and can be modified from the hosting service provider of the website. If we have to make any changes to the DNS records of Krenovate.com, we will have to do the same in our Dreamhost Hosting Account. Refer to the following scenarios to get a better uderstanding and clarity on the same. Scenario 1 - Domain Provider and Hosting Provider are the same.This simply means that you bought a domain on Godaddy and have also bought hosting services from Godaddy itself. Scenario 2 - Domain Provider and Hosting Provider are different This is the scenario of Krenovate.com, the domain name Krenovate.com has been bought and managed on Godaddy , while the website Krenovate.com is hosted on Dreamhost . The following table will help you understand where you will manage your DNS records and nameservers in the aforementioned scenarios. Domain Management Scenario 1 Scenario 2 Nameservers The nameservers are always managed through domain provider account. Godaddy Godaddy DNS Records The DNS records are always managed through hosting provider account. Goddady Dreamhost Scenario 1 \u00b6 The following image will show you that you can see and manage both nameservers and DNS records from your Godaddy account. Scenario 2 \u00b6 The following image will show you that you can only see and manage nameservers from your Godaddy account and it says DNS records cannot be displayed as nameservers are pointed to Dreamhost. 2. A Records \u00b6 The A Record is the most important record as it connects the domain name to the relevant IP address of the hosting server. The following image will show you how to add or edit an A Record in your DNS Records. A Record has the following elements: Type of Record - A Record Host - @ The host name for the record, without the domain name. Points to - The IP address of hosting server TTL - Time to go live 3. CNAME Records \u00b6 CNAME Records are used for managing the subdomains of a website. The following image will show you how to add or edit a CNAME Record in the DNS Records. A typical CNAME Record has the following elements: Type of Record - CNAME Record Host - The name you want to keep for your subdomain Points to - The IP Address of hosting server of the subdomain TTL - Time to go live 4. MX Records \u00b6 MX Records are used for managing the email services of a domain. For example, email ID sharmapuneet@krenovate.com has been running on GSuite, the business version of Gmail. The following image will show you how to add or edit an MX Record in the DNS Records. A typical MX Record has the following elements: Type of Record - MX Record Host - @ (This means that you are running email services on your domain name) Points to - The hosting address of email provider (In this case the hosting provider is Google) Priority - Generally email providers will share multiple MX records with you, and a priority for each of them as well. TTL - Time to go live 5. TXT Records \u00b6 The TXT Records are text records and generally used for verifying ownership of a domain name. Many online service providers to activate their services on your domain name, instruct you to add a custom and unique TXT Record. For example to activate Gsuite on our domain for emailing, we have to add the following TXT Record. A typical TXT Record has the following elements: Type of Record - TXT Record Host - @ (This means that you are pointing to your own domain name) TXT Value - The unique text record shared by some other organisation TTL - Time to go live","title":"Domains Name System (DNS)"},{"location":"Domains-and-hosting/DNS/#domain-name-systems","text":"","title":"Domain Name Systems"},{"location":"Domains-and-hosting/DNS/#what-is-dns","text":"DNS is the control panel for the domain names we buy on websites like Godaddy.

It is the address where internet users can access the website and also find and identify computers on the Internet. Computers use IP addresses, which are a series of number. However, it is difficult for humans to remember strings of numbers. Because of this, these were developed and used to identify entities on the Internet rather than using IP addresses. It can be any combination of letters and numbers, and can be used in combination of various domain name extensions, such as .com, .net and more. It must be registered before one can use it. No two websites can have the same domain name as it is unique. For example if someone types in krenovate.com, it will go to Krenovate's website and no one else's. URL \u00b6 A URL ( \u201cUniform Resource Locator\u201d ) is a complete web address used to reach a particular web destination. A URL has four major parts: 1. HTTPS / HTTP 2. TLD 3. Domain 4. Sub Domain 1. HTTPS/HTTP \u00b6 One can capture email IDs using simple sign up forms for newsletter of the company for all the people visiting their website. People who will be interested in the products or services will sign up, as they might be interested to get regular updates about the business. The internet has over 1.5 billion websites, the information and data on each website is fetched and presented to us by the HTTP ( Hyper transfer text protocol ) technology that is as old as the internet. The HTTPS ( Hyper transfer text protocol secure ) is a more secure way of fetching & presenting data and information on websites. The data and information on HTTPS websites is encrypted using SSL certificates . These certificates convert any data or information in an encrypted format, so that even if someone gets access to some confidential information data from the website it is an encrypted format and no one can perform any scam or fraud online by using such information. To give a simple example, when we buy anything online by entering our credit card details, e-commerce websites use SSL certificates to convert the data we have entered into an encrypted format, so that no one can use our credit card details for any scammy online purchases. Let\u2019s say our credit card number is 1234 5678 9999 0000 , all HTTPS websites will convert this data into an encrypted format like \u2018kjbdy87343hkdh873837864hdwsdtrsdwte72328627362876826 vsjhdwud67e228736287632\u2019 And this encryption changes every time we enter any data on any HTTPS website.

Also use Google Chrome to safeguard and make people aware about the websites which are not secure.Websites using SSL certificate are marked as safe by Google Chrome. 2. TLD \u00b6 Also known as the top-level domain . The most common used TLD is \u2018.com\u2019. TLDs are generally used as a reference to a geographic area or a type of community, group, organisation. For example, \u2018.com.au\u2019 will reflect that the website is run by an Australian organisation, similarly \u2018.edu\u2019 is a TLD generally used by colleges, schools and educational institutes. There are more than 1,000 TLDs available in the world. Top 10 used TLDs in the world: \u00b6 1) .COM: 82.01 million 2) .DE (Germany): 13.05 million 3) .CN (China): 12.55 million 4) .NET: 12.42 million 5) .UK (United Kingdom): 7.83 million 6) .ORG: 7.79 million 7) .INFO: 5.24 million 8) .NL (Netherlands): 3.5 million 9) .EU (European Union): 2.98 million 10) .RU (Russia): 2.31 million So if we are launching a website for a business in Europe it makes more sense to launch it under the .EU TLD , because people in europe would be more accustomed to open websites with .EU TLD . Also there are some TLDs available which directly represent a business category, like the .AGENCY TLD , so if we are planning to open up an agency for any industry, it makes more sense to buy a domain name under the .AGENCY TLD . TLD's used in world Top 10 used TLDs in the world 3. Domain \u00b6 Kickstarting any business online with a website starts with booking a domain name. Once we have shortlisted the right TLDs based on our business/organisation category the next step is to search and book the domain name. We should follow the guidelines given below to book a domain name. Shortlist relevant TLDs Prefer a single word for our domain name For example the official name of our organisation is \u2018 Krenovate Solutions Pvt Ltd \u2019 but the website runs under the brand name \u2018 Krenovate.com \u2019 \u2018Godaddy\u2019 does not have all TLDs available, book domains on United Domains We can book domain name for extra TLDs (like .co, .co.in, .xyz, .work etc.), which are not very expensive, this will be helpful for bulk email marketing. 4. Sub Domains \u00b6 Apple has a very beautiful website, that anyone can visit by typing in the given Apple link for buying and finding information for all Apple products. On the other hand, customers of Apple, if they want any help or support for their old purchases have to visit Apple customer support link . Both websites ( https://www.apple.com/ ) which is referred to as Apple link here and( https://support.apple.com/)which is referred to as Apple customer support link in this section run on the same domain name i.e. apple.com. These are actually two different websites for different set of users. Visitors of Apple.com and support.apple.com are absolutely different.Prospect or any person who wants to find out any information about Apple visits the main website Apple link , while registered customers of Apple visit Apple customer support link which is a subdomain of Apple.com for help and support on products and services. Any person/organisation who has bought a domain name can create an unlimited number of subdomains without any extra cost. Subdomains help organisations to manage a similar set of users access relevant information on a separate independent website. Advantages of sub domain \u00b6 Specific website for specific stakeholders. Easy to regulate and manage content and information for a specific set of users. Performance of one website does not affect the other, so if one of the subdomain crashes, the others won\u2019t get affected (if all our hosted on separate servers). Designing and planning a website becomes more easy and sensible. All subdomains can eventually run as individual entities. Good for organisations which deal with seperate kind of stakeholders. Please remember, creating subdomains for different products or services is not beneficial as subdomains are only helpful if we have multiple stakeholders. To be more clear, create subdomains only if you have different stakeholders like customers, vendors, suppliers, employees and prospective customers and that too if it cannot be handled on a single website.","title":"Domains"},{"location":"Domains-and-hosting/Domains/#domain","text":"","title":"Domain"},{"location":"Domains-and-hosting/Domains/#domain-name","text":"A domain name is the website name.

When you sign up for a web hosting service, you basically rent some space on a server where you can store all the files and data necessary for your website which can be accessed anytime through the internet to work properly.Hosting is done by the web hosts. Web hosts are companies that rent out their services and technologies to host websites on the internet. Once the hosting company hosts your website, users can access it by typing in your web address (domain name) in their web browser. When they do this, their computer connects to the server your website is hosted on. Servers \u00b6 Servers are machines that store and serve data on request. USB is a server, as it stores your data and when you attach it to a USB port it shows you the files and data in it. Similarly all machines that store data and serve it on request are servers. Servers can be online and offline. Offline servers are your laptop, USB, mobile phones and anything that shows you data without using the internet. Online servers are similar machines which store information and data and are only accessible through the internet. Online servers are provided by hosting providers, companies which are in the business of creating and managing online servers. For example, Godaddy is a hosting provider that offers a range of different types of online servers that you can use to store and run your websites and apps. All online servers have an IP address, which is used to access the information on that server. Difference between Shared amd Cloud hosting \u00b6 Shared Hosting Cloud Hosting 1. Multiple websites are hosted on a single server. 1. Dedicated individual server for each website. 2. All websites have a common IP address. 2. Each website has an exclusive IP address. 3. If the server crashes, all websites go down together. 3. If the server crashes, only the website hosted on it crashes, does not affect other websites. 4. If you buy shared hosting, you get server space in a server that is also being used for other websites. 4. If you buy cloud hosting, you get server space in a dedicated server that is exclusively being used for only your website. 5. You cannot make any technical changes to the server as it is shared. 5. You can make whatever technical changes you want to perform in your cloud server. 6. Good for simple business websites. 6. Good for e-commerce and product based websites. 7. Prices are generally affordable and cheap. 7. Prices are dynamic based on server usage, they go up with the no. of users on your website. Setting Up Cloud Hosting for Wordpress Websites \u00b6 Since we will be training you for website design & development ahead in the course on wordpress websites, we will teach you how you can quickly setup hosting for your wordpress website. Guidelines to select a cloud hosting provider for beginners: Choose a provider where setting up a server is easy. Options like one-click installs are available. Pricing has definite plans with fixed pricing per month. Has good community support and resources to read and learn. Digital Ocean is a platform which has all the aforementioned guidelines for choosing a cloud hosting provider. We will also be using Digital Ocean to teach you how to setup cloud hosting for your wordpress website. Step 1: Make an account on Digital Ocean https://www.digitalocean.com/ \u00b6 Visit Digital Ocean Use the sign up form as shown in the image below to make an account. Step 2: Create a Droplet (Cloud Hosted Server) with One-click Wordpress Installation \u00b6 Log in and click the \u2018CREATE\u2019 button and choose \u2018DROPLETS\u2019 in the dropdown as shown in the image below. Click on \u2018Marketplace\u2019 which has all the options for one-click installations as shown in the image below. We here at Krenovate work on Openlitespeed Wordpress . Choose the option of \u2018WORDPRESS\u2019 from the list in the marketplace, it will be at the end of the list as shown in the image below. Choose a \u2018STANDARD\u2019 plan it\u2019s good enough for any wordpress business website, and select the pricing plan from the available plans, I would suggest you to go get started with $5 plan, as shown in the image below and you can always upgrade as per your needs. Leave the Backup and Block Storage sections as default, as shown in the image below. Choose a \u2018DATACENTER\u2019, this step is important. You should always choose a datacenter which is geographically nearest to your prospective customers. For example, if you are building a website for users who stay in India, you should select \u2018Bangalore\u2019 as a datacenter. Having a datacenter in the same country helps to serve data more quickly to the people visiting the website, making your website experience better for your website visitors.

Web hosts are companies that rent out their services and technologies to host websites on the internet.

Online servers are similar machines which store information and data and are only accessible through the internet. Online servers are provided by hosting providers, companies which are in the business of creating and managing online servers.

Design is how it works.\" -Steve Jobs What is Web Designing \u00b6 It refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than software development. An effective website design should fulfil its intended function by conveying its particular message whilst simultaneously engaging the visitor. Several factors such as consistency, colours, typography, imagery, simplicity and functionality all contribute to good website design. Designing Process \u00b6 In order to design, build, and launch your website, it's important to follow these steps: 1. PLANNING It is the most important because what\u2019s decided and mapped here sets the stage for the entire project. This stage also requires client interaction and accompanying attention to detail. Requirements analysis Project charter Site map Contracts that define roles, copyright and financial points Gain access to servers and build folder structure Determine required software and resources (stock photography, fonts, etc.) 2. DESIGN This stage involves moving the information outlined in the planning stage further into reality. The main deliverables are a documented site structure and more importantly a visual representation. Upon completion of this phase, the website should more or less have taken shape, but for the absence of the content and special features.

UX 2. UI UX \u00b6 What is UX Design ? \u00b6 It is the process of designing products that are useful, easy to use, and delightful to interact with. It is about enhancing the experience that people have while interacting with your product, and making sure they find value in what you are providing. There are seven factors that describe user experience: Useful Usable Findable Credible Desirable Accessible Valuable The key ingredients for a great user experience on a website include the following in the image given below: Why Design is important \u00b6 Without designing, you may waste your time and money. When you are creating a website, it is important to have a design rather a good design for a better outcome. It actually makes a difference on how your target audience views your business or company and potentially turn them into your customers. The design of the application improves the user experience and customer satisfaction that ultimately helps increase the number of users of the specific application. It helps to win the consumers confidence and make them use your application or website providing them what they are looking for. UX Designer Roles and Responsibilities \u00b6 UX designers take the lead role in improving the end user's requirements and try to produce a product that make users happy. The role of a UX designer will be directly involved in the process of making a product useful, usable and enjoyable for the company\u2019s target market. The process generally works in this order: User Research : It involves speaking to real users within the target market about the product, therefore avoiding assumptions and instead making information-driven decisions. UX designers will ask questions about how people feel when they are navigating a current design, and whether the user interface components are easy or difficult to interact with. Questionnaires, focus group discussions, online surveys, and task analysis methods can be used for this. The collected data is deeply analyzed and eventually converted into quantitative and qualitative information which is used for decision making. Design : It is centred around functionality and usability, and not about how it looks. Information architecture, wireframing, and prototyping techniques to design the user's journey are used during this phase. Testing : It involves checking that the changes made during the design phase stand up to scrutiny. It is a great way to get rid of issues/user difficulties that weren't visible in the design phase before getting started on the implementation phase. There are various testing methods such as a/b testing, usability testing, and remote user testing. Implementation : It involves working with web developers to reach the end goal. They work to transform design ideas into a real, working website. It is important to keep the developers in the loop throughout the process so as to make this final phase easier for everyone involved. Wireframe \u00b6 It is a visual representation of an interface using only simple shapes and they look like they were designed with wires and that is where the name comes from. It is a low-fidelity design layout that outlines the specific size, placement of page elements, site features, conversion areas and navigation for your website. They are devoid of color, font choices, logos or any real design elements that take away from purely focusing on a site's structure. It is used early in the development process to establish the basic structure of a page before visual design and content is added. It is the foundation to the User Interface (UI) you will be designing later on. Low fidelity and high fidelity design \u00b6 Reminder:to be addded \u00b6 UI \u00b6 What is UI Design ? \u00b6 It is the process designers use to build interfaces in software/computerized devices, focusing on looks/style. User interface (UI) is the space where interactions between humans and machines occur. These are the access points where users interact with designs. It has three formats: Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) Voice-controlled interfaces (VUIs) Gesture-based interfaces UI Designer Roles and Responsibilities \u00b6 It is the UI designer\u2019s job to bring the UX designer\u2019s vision to life. A UI designer is responsible for creating interactive programs that enhance a customer's experience with a brand and facilitate an enjoyable experience on the website. They are also responsible for ensuring consistency, so creating a style guide, or visual language to be used across the board. Generally they follow the following steps: Collaboration : At the start of the process, the UI designer needs to work closely with both UX designer and client/users. They can clearly know about the requirements of the user/client. As user research and personas are the responsibility of a UX designer but it is the UI designer's job to take this information and run with it as a UX designer will most likely provide you with a wireframe. Now you can hand the design over to the developers as building a rapport and better communication are crucial for the success of your project. Design : It includes designing screens and creating visual touch points, as well as the interactivity behind them. While designing they will consider the following points: How much space should be left between each element? How the app will display on various screen sizes? Designing UI elements such as buttons, icons, sliders and scrollbars Color theory to create an awesome, unique color palette that injects some personality into the website or app. Choosing the correct fonts and typesetting. What does a button do when the user clicks on it? Creating animations. Establishing a style guide to be used throughout the application, ensuring consistency and familiarity for the user. Prototyping It enables you to showcase your visual designs in action, helping you to quickly identify flaws and smooth over any rough edges. Prototyping and testing is a crucial part of the UI design workflow, as it will allow you to ensure that the final product ticks all the boxes.
